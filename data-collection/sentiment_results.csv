Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

best film of 2022,"Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.

"Don't do drugs, watch this instead.","If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.

Fantastic,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""

If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.

Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.

The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.",10/10,20 April 2022,gbill-74877,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
The most original film ever made. Period.,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.

These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.

As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.

All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.

This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.

This movie truly speaks for me,"I can understand why people may not get this movie, or cannot catch up with the plot. Even I was lost at some moments, but seriously, this movie is worth it.

As an Asian teenager with an awkward relationship with my mom, this movie more or less practically describes my life. Before watching this, my mental health was at my worst. I turned out to be a brat in result. Never wanting to socialise, rude to people, and I don't even acknowledge my faults when I do the mistakes. I was depressed wondering the meaning of life. This movie changed my whole mindset.

For a movie that had talking rocks and suspicious-looking trophies, I'm surprised I can be even EMOTIONAL at the very last few scenes. The messages... be kind to people, live up to your fullest and to your best because why not? Nothing matters, right? After that day, I try to improve myself, you know. Think before I act, not try to be cocky all the time, be less toxic around people and my loved ones. And overall, 2022 and 2023 got so much better for me. My school performance improved and so did my social life.

And I hope it forever will improve the lives of other people too. Thanks for reading.

The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!,"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.

And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!

Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.

This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.

EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.

Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.

There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!

If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.

Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",9/10,25 March 2022,iamianiman,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
This is the best movie of the year?!,"Ok, the movie contains a lot, a lot. It contains impressive action, drama, SF, humor as well as numerous incredible scenes and shots. I give him a big plus for his incredible originality and idea. However, for me personally, the film was a little too much, to put it that way. In the context of the Oscars, it's also incredible to me that the film picked up so many important awards. Is this the best movie of the year?! Reading numerous reviews and comments, it's clear to me that I'm in the minority and that's why I'm surprised by all the hype surrounding the film. For some, this is even one of the best films ever made. Due to these expectations, I have to admit that the film did not impress me at all. It's not a problem for me to admit that it's up to me and that I can't understand the magnitude of the film, which will obviously be a cult classic tomorrow. But I am surprised that such a strange film won over so many people.

Absolute Stunner of a Film - Sure to Be 2022's Best,"2022 is not even halfway over, but I saw Everything, Everywhere last night, and I simply cannot imagine it not being the best film of 2022.

To say I was stunned is an understatement. I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.

I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I've watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.

Last night's screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.

This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.

In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.

Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It's hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It's the fiercest performance I've seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I've seen in years.

As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.

I don't rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.

Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.

Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.

And at the end of the day, maybe that's everything.",10/10,31 March 2022,paulbrobertson,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
"I don't get the hype, it really was just so so","Starting with what I did enjoy about this movie.

1. The setting of this movie was indeed a more accurate representation of an Asian American household. The family dynamics sounds about right. I like that Asians are getting more spotlight.

2. The concept/theme of this movie is rather novel and therefore interesting. Although I think it could have been played out much more sophisticatedly.

3. The parent-child relationship is well portrayed. The perceived lack of validation from parents felt by the child, the poorly communicated love of the parent, the process of gaining awareness and emotional growth for both the parent and child is inspiring.

Things I didn't like 1. It is a very bizarre movie, you could even say chaotic. It's as if they tried to combine every single meaningless detail together and gave up filtering out what's actually worth or necessary to the main plot. Tried too hard to make it funny/original/emotional/relatable that it ends up being neither of those things very well.

2. The movie is also unnecessarily long.

Those two points combined makes this movie just a long, confusing, and sometimes boring mess. The novelty makes it watchable/bearable, but to me, it's nothing more than that.",6/10,5 May 2022,evetonemesis,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE
A Metaphor of Love for Ordinary Lives,"Anybody who thinks this film is about multiverses really misses the point. The multiverses are simply metaphors for the more ""successful"" or exciting lives that we sometimes dream that we might have had. To quote the summarising lines ""Here all we get are a few specks of time where any of this actually makes any sense"". The reply is ""Then I will cherish those few specks of time"". So the meaning of life isn't about success or glamour or achievement. As the film says in life ""Nothing matters"" (or nothing really matters - like Freddy said!). So life is about relationships and those few ""specks of time"" when we share with others the magic moments that make the.golden memories that define our lives. Just a few magic specks of time.

Bit incredulous at the amount of Oscars....,"Firstly I should say I thought the actors did put in some very good performances and I can see why they were nominated although as to whether they deserved to beat some of their competitors is another matter.

I have to say I found this film to be tedious and almost unenjoyable to watch. It feels like a film made for the TikTok generation - no overall coherence with nuggets of scenes rammed together. Is this a film I would ever bother watching again - absolutely not.

Yes it is different - in much the same way The Artist was (and who talks about that film anymore?) but that doesn't make it good. It aims for a profound message whilst its style is overwhelmingly superficial. It's a film with little artistic merit or dare I say beauty (I am talking about the scenes and cinematography here not the actors) and it definitely did not move me except to pray it was going to finish.

In short it barely ticks the boxes of what I'd consider to be essential criteria for a great movie. Maybe this is the first of a new wave of this type of film and I am not getting it but when it had finished I felt pretty much nothing.",6/10,13 March 2023,JBLOSS,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE
What?,"Im embarrassed for Hollywood. Not criticizing the actors, Im sure they are good- but Im not going to pretend this movie was good. Are people doing this to seem smart? Not working. I compare this movie to a nighmare about a completely unmanageable life without peace. How is this a good movie? What is going on? Most of the reviews are horrible yet it won all the awards. No. Im all about creativity but no way. I could not even watch all the way through. It was like a train wreck meets drowning and a panic attack. Academy, who are you? Please stop; it sort of makes the Academy seem unhinged. I think there are enough lying liars in the world without pretending Horrible movies are good movies. From now on, the nominated movies will be my list of ""do not watch under any circumstances."" The opposite of everything is true is now the United States.

A beautifully unique exploration of nihilism,"Wow, what a movie. Being able to be so wacky yet so profound is difficult, but this movie is able to to do it all at once(no pun intended)! The main characters exploration of her relationships with her father, husband, and especially her daughter ground the movie, but it's willingness to turn the mundane what if scenarios that we make up in our heads into plot points is truly something special. While it drags on just a tad near the end, this movie is a must watch, and expect it to get some Oscar nods this coming year.

What a perfect title for this movie.,"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.

Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.

Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.

Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.

Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.

The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.

It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)

The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!

I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",9/10,26 March 2022,subxerogravity,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
Near Flawless Film,"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.

The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.

Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.

The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?

That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.

I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.

Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.

Thank you for this movie.",9/10,1 April 2022,statuskuo,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
One word: OVERRATED.,"Having seen countless raving reviews about this movie both on IMDb, and even more so on Twitter, I thought ""damn, I have to go see this ASAP"". I went in expecting something incredible, movie of the year standard, but wow was I disappointed.

Literally 75% of the movie is fight scenes, like okay it was cool at the start but 2 hours in and still?? 'Everything Everywhere' is perfect for people with a short attention span because there's always something ridiculous going on. I understood what they were trying to do with the plot but honestly nothing stuck, it just felt shallow.

Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film, but it's nowhere near these 10/10 reviews that's being advertised.

Shut up and just appreciate your life!,"What better, more urgent message can a film have these days? What's so uncool about movies with messages anyways? Sometimes we desperately need them. I read a couple of reviews lightly mocking any attempt to find deeper meaning amid all the silliness, as if there wasn't enough already on the surface. What if we stopped equating tiny with insignificant? What if the more minuscule we discovered ourselves to be, the LARGER our world became, and the more SIGNIFICANT we felt? So it's not surprising that Daniels take us on the most inventive, overstuffed, relentless journey only to land us in the simplest, most heartfelt of places. That's the real judo-move here -- an infectious, goofy sweetness that extends even to the (hundreds? Thousands?) of action set pieces. Anyone can dimension-hop and fight the baddies. This combination of heart and spirit is the Daniels own. Also, for anyone who's putting together the next time capsule of human civilization, please consider the scene of Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis dancing with wiener fingers.

It Seemed Endless,"There's a point here where we are swept up in sensory overload, where so much stuff is thrown at us that we tune it out. I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen. But I ended up exhausted and unsatisfied.

Some of the most fun I've ever had while watching a movie.,"There's really something for just about everyone in this movie. It's part Kung-fu action, part absurdist comedy, part cerebral sci-fi, and part indie family drama. I think this is an instant classic that uses the art of cinema and movie-making to it's fullest potential.

They really throw everything AND the kitchen sink at the wall and somehow it all sticks and becomes a really fun and really special film that I would recommend to pretty much anyone.

Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as is the whole cast. The writing and direction is phenomenal and innovative and creative and it features of the best editing I've ever seen. It's a really wild movie, but if you sit back and absorb it, I think you'll have a good time.

Way overhyped,"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.

"It's okay people, you're not alone!","With regard to the hordes of people who have praised this film, I've abandoned the idea of the ""Emperor's new clothes"" or herd dynamics in favour of a medical disorder of epidemic proportions - this being Visual Agnosia. I have of course questioned whether it's a personal failing on my own behalf but dropped this idea following consultation with other likeminded individuals who seem tuned in to the here and now. Let's be clear, I like quirky, and I recognise and appreciate originality, and of course clever humour and emotional depth. These are all central components in my appreciation of a good film. However, I have to say that I recognised none of these characteristics in Everything Everywhere All at once. For me, it was simply a convoluted mess that encompassed some naive notions of ""imaginary science"" alongside trite everyday woes. As for humour! I guess that's subjective, but banana skin slapstick is hardly sharp-end comedy. And for budding screenwriters, the depth of the dialogue between two incongruous rocks might be an example not to follow.

Insufferable Intolerance All at Once,"A lousy movie. The underlying themes are the best there are but are used in a way that is nothing short of shameful. Two and a half hours of pure dementia, arrogance and useless effects without any substance. I wonder how this film can be considered as the best of the first half of 2022. A waste of time, health, expectations and enthusiasm. Garbage.

Most accurate title ever,"This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).

"With its strong storyline and amazing parallel universes, this sci fi movie sets a new bar for sci fi","Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.

Bonkers!,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as ""Daniels"", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.

Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.

That's just about the end of the ""normal"" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.

It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as ""Big Nose"", a regular customer at the laundromat.

As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!

I don't get the hype,"I FINALLY sat down to finish watching this movie. I had started it when it first came out to stream and turned it off about 20 minutes in, I found it so boring.

But, last night I decided to sit down and finish watching it to see if it lived up to all of the hype and Oscar accolades...to me, it didn't.

Don't get me wrong, I do feel Mechelle Yeoh did a great job with this very complicated role, so perhaps she deserved it...but the rest of them, ehhhhhh maybe, maybe not so much.

This movie TOTALLY lost my husband, he just couldn't keep up with the different story-lines in different dimensions, and the fast-pace of jumping around from dimension to dimension often game me the ""what in the world is going on"" feeling. I get it....everything all at once, but sometimes way too much.

This movie, for me, didn't make sense at all until the last 20 minutes or so when, at that point finally, the writers basically spoon-fed the viewer the meaning of the movie, because (in my own personal opinion) even they knew people wouldn't get it on their own.

As for Jamie Lee Curtis, I also think she deserved her Oscar for this one. Hers was also a pretty complicated character in oh so many ways and a huge departure from many roles she has played.

So was this an Oscar worthy movie....eeeehhhh, not so much. Were there good performances? Yes. Was this an original movie? Yes, I can appreciate that too.

Was it over-hyped? Most definitely.",6/10,20 March 2023,anitam,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE
Epic and Bizarre,"I dont often give a film 10 stars, but this was superb. It was an intense and bizarre ride, with the strange concepts stretching so far out there at times, it was as though they made more sense. It was visually stunning, the costumes were epic, and the balance of humor and emotion was perfect. LOVED IT. No one else was meant for this role other than Michelle Yeoh. She brought the lead to life in the most beautiful, meaningful, perfect way. This whole movie was mind blowing.

The best movie of the 2020s so far,"Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was ""a woman tries to do her taxes,"" and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.

All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.

The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.

All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.

Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.

I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.

Believe the hype.

i don't understand,"There was a time we had master pieces of sci-fi and story telling like the Matrix, for example, that weren't even nominated to the oscar of best picture. And now we have this messy convoluted story of a film winning everything everywhere at the same time. Can anyone make sense of this??

The quality of this film is at the same level as the matrix sequels, and that's the best i can put it, when i watched it i could never think this would get so much buzz. The bar is set very low this days i guess. It's one of those films you watch it one time and you're done with it.

I give it a 6 because it's not bad movie. Just an ok movie.

SP🎯T-🎯N Magnificent.,"Michelle Yeoh and the rest of the cast and crew KNOCK this mind-bending, mile-a-minute, multi-universe film right out of the entirety of space and time, and take our minds, funny bones and our hearts along for the ride!!! In short, this film is ingenuously, honestly, chaotically, beautifully, disgustingly (in parts), quietly, reflectively, frantically, open-heartedly, MAGNIFICENT.

I giggled, laughed, snickered, cried (in both senses) and mostly, FELT.

It is one of the best films of our time, and I say this truly and with my heart on my sleeve: 1). If you have not seen it, don't waste another minute without seeing it. It is more than a film - it is an EXPERIENCE. 2). If you are someone who has seen it but were not quite transported through the exquisite subtleties or the outright power of this film, do YOURSELF a favor (I mean that) and watch it again - this time maybe with subtitles throughout the entire thing so as not to miss one iota of its utter brilliance. 💞

Aimless,"This film wasn't for me. Weird for the sake of being weird. What it attempted to do was something that can't be done. Similar to TENANT, it's a concept of the intangibles with the overall theme of love falling flat because there's simply too much going on.

Hence the name.

It's well acted, well produced with amazing choreography but as a movie its just odd. Original yes, but odd and hard to become attached.

A Result Of Tedious And Meticulous Teamwork,"10/10, almost no flaw.

Once, I thought that my head will explode while I enduring this movie. I mean, I think this is the most awesome movie I saw in 2022 so far!

Datuk Michelle Yeoh, simply put, Amazing. Outstanding performance.

Perhaps, this is her best performance yet & could win her a couple of film awards this year.

I mean, after two hours the credit scene rolls - I still can't stop thinking about the whole movie.

This movie is not just about art, but to me it felt like a masterpiece that comes out from a dedicated and harworking team.

The casts are perfect. The storyline and plots were more entertaining than I what bargained for. The memorable scripts, the outstanding CGI, the brilliant fighting scene, the awesome-awesome costumes and the small-small jokes scattered throughout the whole movie - it's a movie that I can watch over and over and over again & will not get bored.

This movie stood up differently, unlike most recent ones.

This movie is not overhyped. It is; Everything Everywhere All At Once.

Hats off to Datuk Michelle Yeoh & the team for their hard works and effort.

It looked like my childhood games, where someone would say a piece of a story, then another one completes it. Not funny, just random. The drama didn't catch me either. I may have smiled one time along the whole movie. My girlfriend slept. The film has its moments and its great a indie film is grabbing attention, but please see with low expectations. If this is the best film ever, I just want to quit cinema. Or probably people are seeing only marvel movies. Actually, Wandavision is way better. Nice film, just not the best ever like everybody is saying.

Good To See Miss Yeoh,"Michelle Yeoh owns a failing laundromat with her nebbishy husband Ke Huy Quan, who has just served her with divorce papers. They are being audited by IRS agent Jamie Lee Curtis. Her father, James Hong, threw her out when she married, and is now her wheelchair-bound dependent. Her daughter, Stephanie Hsu, has a girlfriend, which she cannot explain to her father. Then, during a terrible session with Miss Curtis, Quan takes off his glasses and in an authoritative voice tells her that only she can save the multiverse; from this reality defined by all the bad choices ever made, she must tap the abilities of the versions of herself who are more successful than she is; this means every one of them. She is the worst version of herself. Naturally, she is confused, particularly when she discovers that the ultimate evil that threatens all realities is her daughter.

It certainly gives Miss Yeoh a chance to stretch her acting muscles and the editing is wonderful. This sort of story is an enjoyable ""wheels of time"" story, and tackles the nihilism at the heart of the subgenre: if every decision you make was decided differently in another universe, what difference does it make?

My cousin enjoyed most of it but thought the ending sentimental. I thought the sentimental ending was appropriate. What a pity the industry hasn't made better use of Miss Yeoh!

Tries to be everything all at once and fails at most of it.,"To be honest I don't know what the hell I just watched. Bland family drama, comedy, action, science fiction, all haphazardly mashed together into a +2 hours senseless new-agey blob.

The family drama which runs at the core of the movie feels strangely forced, specially in the third act which drags on forever. Most jokes are genuinely funny at first, but some of them are dragged for way too long and stretched thin and a few others are bordering cringe territory. Spends an unnecessary amount of time explaining the multiverse concept that drives the comedic/action parts. Character development is basically absent.

On the bright side, action scenes are well choreographed and imaginative. If you want some wild, absurd, flashy action mixed with cheap tear-jerking, go see this.

Hollywood has lost its mind,"This movie could benevolently be described as an experiment in movie making. It has hardly any plot, copies from many different genres and is at times so hectic that it is hard to follow. In the end they try to tie it all together to a sentimental and nihilistic message about the value of relationships over accomplishments in life. As such, some people might enjoy it but my wife and I would have walked out if we had not been there with friends.

But I have a problem with all the accolades like the Oscars for best movie and for some of the actors. That used to mean something. But to call this the best of the year and to give Jamie Lee Curtis an award for this nothing of a performance shows how they have lost their way and the respect for their audience. They are mocking us. This movie is art in the sense that drawing a mustache on the Monas Lisa could be called art. Hollywood is hard at work of making itself irrelevant.

Not Worthy of Best Picture,"Because it had won best picture, I felt obligated to watch. The start of the movie, the scene in the apartment above the laundromat, was chaotic to the point of making me uneasy and anxious. About 40 minutes in, I literally wondered if viewers were supposed to be high to enjoy it. It didn't evoke any emotions in me, however, at times I did laugh - not with the movie, but at the movie.

Once I commit to watching a movie, I see it through to the end, hoping it will improve and I ultimately become invested in its resolution. But you know a movie is total trash when someone in this household says, ""let it play,"" before leaving the room. It was a colossal waste of time.

Hope. Kindness. Are you listening?,"This movie captures all the pain and angst and joy and absurdity of life all at once. I'm not even sure the writers meant it to be such an existential experience but it was for me. They break our lives down into the relationship within this one family but it's goes so far beyond the obvious need to heal relationships and let go of unfulfilled expectations that get in the way of loving one another. The movie speaks to our current pain. Our hopelessness. Our disconnection as we fight over our truths. It speaks to finding hope in the absurdity of our individual lives. Meaning in the meaningless. And of living life within the paradox of death. Were you listening? Or do you need to watch it again?

A family dealing with family trauma, guilt, regret, self consciousness and love and it is expressed in a very bizarre and fun way. I personally adore this movie with all my heart and cry every time i watch it, it may not do it for everyone however and a lot of people won't get this movie. It is a movie made with love and affection and a bagel. When nothing matters, every little thing matters. Cherish the moments in life and live with joy.

Nothing Nowhere All at Once,"Did I watch a different movie? The entire beginning was a fast-paced convoluted mess of nonsense, that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken English. Sure, the story was unique, but all the attempt at humor was a fail, and thus made the story feel infantile. As for the acting, everyone was pretty much annoying except for Michelle Yeoh, of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.

Overhyped is all I could say,"Not a bad movie at all. But I expected more from a movie that won seven oscars. The main plotline could have been different from sexuality. There are lot of issues other than this that could have been a core for the family storyline. The multiversal concept was nicely blended as it should ideally be for this genre. The only problem I have is with the propaganda that comes in every movie and this is probably the sole reason why it was being pushed towards mainstream media. The acting, direction, cinematography is quite good, has a lot of finesses specially the character of the husband. But at times, the story might stretch even though the pacing is fast and there is no explanation as to why this was the case.

A beautifully wild piece of art.,"I would like to paint a picture for those who read this, imagine that all you have to go in for this movie is the title and the photo of Michelle Yeoh protecting her family behind her. What movie do you think that is?

Answer is you most definitely guessed wrong, there is no way to.accurately know where this movie is going. It travels at the speed of light, fully embracing the weird zany imagination of it's two directors.

I was truly surprised at every turn and brought to an emotional crescendo by the climax. I want to scream about this movie to the heavens, but I think the absolute best way to see it is completely blind. I will definitely see it again when it goes to theaters and take as many people as I can with me.

It was just fine. Hear me out...,"At the risk of angering what seems to be the entire movie going populous, I'm just gonna say it - this movie is fine.

Funny in places, exciting in places, pretty emotional in places. But can someone please explain why movies these days feel like they need to be so damn long? Seriously, this could have been 100 minutes, easily. It's way too indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and when they're over you're still no further to any semblance of plot clarity than you were 10 minutes earlier. It seems like they shot tonnes of footage and just wanted to include it all, without really embellishing the actual story. If the movie was more succinct and arrived more quickly at the overall point of the narrative, that being her connection with her daughter, I would have liked it a lot more.

I just really don't understand why producers and writers are electing their films to be these immense lengths these days when they really don't need to be. No Way Home, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, Drive My Car, all over 2 hours for no good reason.

I really felt the length of this movie was to the detriment of the overall narrative and it disallowed me appreciating what the message was meant to be.

That being said, the direction and editing was cool, acting was strong and the scene at the end with the daughter really did hit all the right notes. You could have trimmed a lot of fat off of this though and made it far stronger in my opinion.

Nothing Nowhere All Too Long,"I'm glad Short Round can still find work, and maybe Indiana Jones could have added some sense to this, but a bad take off of Buckaroo Banzai that runs 2&1/2 hours isn't great cinema. It was like a low budget Jackie Chan remake of '2001 a Space Odyssee' and they never leave the planet, do more emotional quarreling than kung fu fighting, leaving the ending needing a space baby to hug and instead you get a bagel, with no cream cheese. After reading all of the rave reviews about this movie and finally watching it I started to believe in alternative universes and suspect I must be living in one because 'Big Trouble in Little China' deserved an Academy Award before this turkey.

"Nothing, nowhere, all at once","Very painful watch. I had to do it in three takes. Just pompous and grotesque: no backbone, erratic, superficial. If the intention was a tale about ordinary lives and multiverse dreams, it falls flat.

The accolades and the praises are shocking. The vacuum of this movie is impressive.

The musical theme during the credits is good. Except that, my rating is 0 all way through.

Characterization is between non-existing and cliché. There is no multiverse alternative worlds in the film. It shows only trivial reality in various disguises. The artificial collage and the poor rendition of the concept deliver production of cold images. The film is not an immersing experience as probably was its ambition. Bad-Bad, to me. Maybe I am not alone to have watched it this way.

Some people won't get it. But if you're burdened by a nihilistic thoughts and in search of some meaning in a depressing world, this film is a wonderful reminder of why we keep going.

An ode to Chinese migrant mothers,"This movie was a fantastic telling of a Chinese migrant's story in an English speaking country. It's the story of my mother, and many others like her.

These women left all that was familiar and known for a country where they did not speak much of the language, or understand much of the culture. They left when most people are in their prime, when their potential was just about to blossom, and went to run a small business and live frugally so that their children could have a brighter future. But that future is a sea of unknown possibility, one that cannot be controlled, or even necessarily understood.

Michelle Yeoh does an incredible job (as she always does) of portraying a woman who is coming to terms with the internal conflicts of her past sacrifices, emotional trauma, cultural expectations, the love for her daughter, her relationship with her husband, and the harsh, unforgiving realities of running a small business in the US. Ke Huy Quan similarly amazes with his acting ability, becoming switching between different versions of the same man at the drop of the hat and portraying the typically misunderstood and underestimated, quietly spoken Asian man to perfection.

The story is about how our internal conflicts can both hinder and help us on our path to reconciliation and becoming the best versions of ourselves through choice and acknowledgement.

As a first generation migrant to an English speaking country from Hong Kong, I want to thank the entire movie team for their kind, nuanced, entertaining and heartfelt telling of our mothers' migrant stories. For telling this story in its messy entirety, and not just settling for a hygienic, polite version reiteration of migrants achieving the American dream, you have done us all an enormous service.",10/10,10 May 2022,petrifiedpencils,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
"Gratuitous weirdness, but that's the whole point","It's hard to criticize this film cause it works as a an insane story, in an insane world, and is obviously appreciated by many people.

Strange how it was like a rollercoaster ride but also really boring at the same time, with no real purpose beyond 'be kind', and 'accept people'. Both nice themes but paper-thin to sustain a 2+ hour movie.

There's a superficial level of excitement, a key element of the plot is 'do random stuff' and that's okay, but beyond that there's not much more. It just depends on how you like your entertainment.

What a great film!,"It is great to see a movie that steps outside of the standard boundaries of normal film.

This film can be a metaphor for so many things spiritual and what can represent meaning in our lives.

I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has not seen it and who also has an open mind.

I'm surprised not to see this on the top 250 movies on IMDb. Since I believe it's a passes, so many of the other titles on the list.

Hopefully we can see more from the producers and writers who have helped put this film together.

3 course-chocolate-mousse-meal,"I was positively surprised with the first 30 minutes as I had not watched the trailer and was not expecting anything special. Well, it was special and I enjoyed it even though I felt like stuck in a nightmare watching the scenes and jokes repeating again and again. What sounded like a genius plot at first, quickly becomes an everlasting dad joke as the story unfolds.

Ironically, the story lacks of dimensions. It felt like we are served a nice chocolate mousse as a starter and then the main course is also a chocolate mousse and surprise surprise the dessert is also a chocolate mousse. You still eat it because you like it but it does not taste the same at some point.

One important disclaimer comes from the fact that I did not watch EEAAO in the theater, which I heard is a game changer. However, I do not believe that sound or visual effects could improve the flatness of the jokes.",6/10,8 September 2022,vgdfjjkrv,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE
"It's not for everyone, but it WAS for me.","This movie was amazing. It was weird and funny and deep. I realize that not everybody has been through things. Not everybody can appreciate a movie that can have you gasping while you scream 'WTF IS THIS' 😂😂😂😩 and also bring a tear to your eye, make you want to go wake up your sleeping baby to hug them and also make you want to look into the center of your lover's eye for a just second longer. It's a beautiful movie. I feel genuinely sorry for those that did not enjoy it. It's something I honestly can't comprehend. There is something there for everyone. Anyone who has ever felt a real 'everything bagel' or seen it suck someone you love up it, can definitely relate. Where that bagel is a bad relationship, addiction, someone with a massive wall around them. You get the point. It's a sensation that I had from many years ago. It's a gut punch, it's the sense of impending loss, dread, horror and love annyway, all at once. It really is everything everywhere all at once.

Not at all as good as advertised,"I've been looking forward to this movie since so many people and critics, whose opinions I trust think this is such a great piece of art. While I did laugh a few times, and can give it a six out of 10 because the acting is really nice, the story is just...... How do I put this... Too hard to follow... With some of the best parts being meaningless to the overall plot... Which, based on the way that it ended, apparently everything all together, and all at once was meaningless to the story based on the way it ended . If you dig kung fu and fight scenes, or somehow feel a multiverse connection because of superhero movies you have enjoyed, you may not come away from this with as sour a taste as me. But when the most profound scene includes two rocks conversing...

i'm too old for this s*it,"Either too old or to stupid, but in any case I could not comprehend the film. If the idea was that there was no meaning, no hope and no chance (even if you thought you found some, you 'd be proven wrong by form C) there was too much of everything everywere at once.

No chance of a successfull mother and daughter relationship and a total chaos in whatsoever universes that may exist are the only messages I got. Although the film is imaginative, the imagination is of a suicidal and depressing kind, so I can not understand 7 Oscars.

In defense of the film I have to admit that I'm 61, so I just can not appreciate video gaming style of directing.

Annoying gibberish mess.,"Some people seem to really love this movie, and that's fine. I hated it though, I bailed after 30 mins and have no desire to see if it got any less bad.

Annoying, hyperactive gibberish. Here's a clue - if you want to hook your audience in, don't spend the first half hour of the movie having your characters bicker with each other and then introduce nausea-inducing camera moves on top of that.

Michelle Yeoh is a great actor, and this studio has put out some great movies. But I am totally at a loss as to why everyone is banging on about this irritating mess of a movie. It's the cinematic equivalent of having wasps fired at your eyes for 8 hours.

The heart has its reason that reason knows nothing of,"If you open your mind and your heart, u can see the film's meaning. It's a message of love in a land of war, a scream of unity (as family, friends, humans..) in a society of individuals, an hymn to the failure in a world of forced success. It's human and should be more intimistic or more adventurous, but it's what we are & what we should be. The better version of us is inside & not outside: changing is possible everytime, everywhere & all at once!

Sorry for my English but I only want to add my little voice at the others that describes with better words this incredible, beautiful, lovely & gorgeous film where all is one & one is all!

Stunned,"I'm 68 years old and have seen a lot of films in my time. There have been only a few times when I've left the theater in something of a state of awe for what I've seen. This was one of those times. It is a psychedelic rollercoaster, a Kung Fu flick, a love story, a family story, an immigrant saga and a comedy all wrapped up in quantum physics. It is also surprisingly moving at times and the ultimate message of the film is sorely needed today. I really can't praise it highly enough though I know it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Michelle Yeoh was simply amazing.

A point from a chinese,"The story is talk about the relationship fixtion between the mom and Family member. In hollywood directors usually didn't to direct such movies Which talk about the chinese cultures and families opinion. So a lot of people didn't know about the feeling in the movie. But this movie is different. Actually i can see this movie is fantastic. Because this movie can talk clearly about the real chinese mind. They think the family is a priority thing.

In the movies the mom always care about their daughter's feeling and try to help him although sometimes the way is not good enough but the heart is the genuine. That is a true portrait as a Chinese mom.

So if you want to fix the relationship between you and your family member. I will recommend this movie.

What was the point?,"I will agree with lots of poor reviews here by the audience. As much as I would like to love this film, it did not do something different for me. The concept of the film, the reasoning behind the plot is quite similar to the movie ""tenet."" And the reason is ""nothing at all.""

The movie runs us through the problems of the main character and how different choices made by her could have meant a ""better life"" than the one she already has. But the main reasoning for all of the action and plot was confined down to her daughter's issues with her. It'd have been interesting if the main character was the villain in the alternate universe, where she snapped and gotten all vengeful of the universe/s as she crumbled down the years of emotional and mental torture.

Also don't even get me started on the bagel. It was an annoying detail in the film, i don't know if I need to have an artistic mind to actually appreciate that concept but I truly do not.

It's a good action movie but not a great sci-fi movie. Which is why 7⭐ is for the action, acting and overall attractive scenes. You just have to turn your brain off in order to enjoy it without thinking about it in the back of your mind. The movie is infact not worth the hype, watching it or not watching it wouldn't make a difference in how you understand the concepts of science or the possibility of alternate realities.",7/10,13 January 2023,zaidqasim-98917,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE

Did an AI bot write the script?,"A seemingly purposeful mess of nonsense. Nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. I wanted to enjoy this but it was contrived, left no meaning apart from 'there's this concept of a multiverse' and we should appreciate what we have in life. Big and good concepts, but there's a detachment in how the story is told. Just too chaotic to create something you can latch on to, so it becomes unintentionally superficial. On the upside the acting is great, with well deserved gongs for the leads. Why do I have write six hundred characters for one of these reviews? I've made my points concisely without switching people off with a case of TLDR.

"Cool, unique and family drama under sci-fi","It might be the first time i cried since spirited away. I despise rating system, and i don't normally do this. Cause reviews are subject and sometimes way too personal.

But Everything Everywhere All at Once is just built different. I didn't expect to get that much experience watching a film with the tacky multi-universe sketch. But i'm genuinely surprised and overwhelmed by how good it helps the plot. This design is not just used to create a Nolan-ish crazy high-budget scene, but serves as a perfect bridge to the ending.

The ending just makes me bawl like a baby. Again, any asian child or any child can relate so much to this movie. Wonderful, wonderful job from the two Daniels.

As it was it just went on too long with too much repetition and a failrly obvious family resolution playing out far longer than needed. It was a film in dire need of an editor.

Ke Huy Quan couldn't save this :(,"I kept putting off watching this, even though I kept hearing about how great it was. I finally got around to it, and sadly, it was all around disappointing. And this is even my favorite kind of genre. I love sci fi, time travel, matrix, multiverse, Rick and Morty, etc. I also love random, silly and unexpected.

The problem is that even though this movie has all of that, its all completely overdone and over saturated. It would have been a good move to have it moderately sprinkled in but they lean way too heavily on random/weird acts to stimulate multiverse skills. It gets old very quickly. It literally feels like everyone is just running around doing the first random thing that comes to mind....

One of the other key problems is that 90% of the shooting is done in a office space, mall or laundromat. It feels extremely limiting and extremely low budget. This felt all around like a B movie. The few moments of CGI look terrible.

Most of everything here has been done before, like in the Matrix, Ready Player One, or countless other imitations. I was extremely bored halfway through and began to play it at 1.25 speed just to get it over with more quickly. Its over 2 long hours of runtime

As for the casting, I really enjoyed Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang, his opening scenes with the fanny pack were fun and brilliant. He is the star of the movie and almost saves it. But EVERYONE else felt miss cast to me. Especially the mother and daughter. Nothing about their performance was realistic or convincing. I will probably get downvoted for this but I'm sorry; a middle aged tiny woman is NOT going to be able to throw down two grown men in a single power move, one in each hand. I can get kung fu and other skills but giving her superhuman strength at times took me out.

There also isn't much depth to the characters. It was nice to have her focus on saving her daughter but it felt rushed. And the other item was their pending divorce versus how their lives might have been had they remained single. That was an interesting focus but it didn't get a ton of attention.

This movie also struggles to establish a consistent tone. On one hand you have heartfelt, serious conversations; trying to establish itself and be taken seriously. And then the next moment, you see the daughters cult all has bagels painted on their foreheads and a universe where people have hot dog hands. It goes from extremely random to extremely serious in a blink. It doesn't work for me.

I think there was an effort here to appear more smart and clever than they actually are. Most threads were pretty easy to follow and were pretty predictable, the attempt at appearing mysterious just doesn't really work either.

The underlying theme here is finding meaning. Finding meaning in our choices, different paths that we might take and all the different experiences we could potentially experience in a lifetime. To me, this is the strongest focus of the movie and had great potential to be something special; too much of this gets ran over by everything else.

Beautiful art that makes you FEEL,"I saw this film in April 2022 without knowing anything about it; I went into the theater blind and not expecting anything in particular. By the end of the film I was shocked by how much I had laughed and cried.

The chaos demonstrated throughout the film is indicative of the chaos of our current world, the chaos in our minds as we try to navigate our careers and families and self, and the chaos of the unknown. I don't think I've ever teared up quite as much I did at the conclusion of the film. In the end, this is a movie about empathy, family, love, and kindness. The pure, unfiltered emotion that pours from this movie is so magical. I love-LOVE-a movie that can make me feel so much.

"Many good parts, not really good as a whole","A very ambiguous one. If we take any other aspect of it, it can be really good. The acting is great, the cinematography is cool, the editing is a masterpiece, the music is really good - but it was all put together in a very weird way.

Crazy stories are fun when everything is in the right order, when nothing is exaggerated, but you can't say that about this movie. It's like the creators took LSD or some funny shrooms and started tripping while someone else wrote down everything they said while they were tripping. It's sick. It's like that bagel with everything stuffed in it, both tasty and nasty. And it doesn't taste any good.

You can't unite the disparate in the hope that it can somehow make something good. No, it can't. I can understand an Oscar for Best Actress and Best Film Editing, but the rest of the statues should have gone to other people. I can't get this mindless awarding. And I'll never watch it again.

There will be a before and after this movie,"I watched this movie with my wife. She hated it. I loved it. It's that kind of movie. You either love it or you hate it. The bits that made me laugh were the bits that lost my wife. She thought it was ridiculous at times. That it went too far. I disagree. Like the 1st Matrix, the concept here allows for everything to be possible. Imagination is the limit. The Matrix being a blockbuster action movie, it was stuck within its own limitations. This independent movie has no limitations, no boundaries and it shows. It goes as far as it can. It made me care, it made me laugh, it made me unconformable at times. It made me feels many emotions that a sci-fi movie doesn't usually make you feel. This movie is a metaphor, an allegory of life. In the end it made me reflect on my own life and my past choices.

I understand it's not a movie for everyone. I don't judge. It's not about ""getting it"". I understand some people don't like it and feel a bit angered by the overall praise.

Anyway, it's a bold movie that took some major risks. And it paid off. I believe other movies will learn from this one and be inspired by it. And that there is a before and after this movie.",10/10,13 March 2023,templeshade,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
Way overrated,"With all the buzz around this movie I expected something bonkers, creative, refreshening, new. And well, it was nothing of that.

First let's start by the most obvious and what apparently people do not understand - this is not a movie about the multiverse and alternate realities. This is a movie about the joy of family and being together. All the alternate realities are just an allegory and I think clearly in the protagonist head, a way to cope with her sad life. It helps her remember that relationships, her husband, her daughter, her father - that's what is important in life and moments of kindness.

This is the whole story. A nice message but really not very original.

And regarding the ""bonkers"" moments and aspects - there was nothing I had not already seen in another movie.

Sorry did not work for me.

Most of the film is just random stuff like hotdog fingers and raccoon ratatouille, that's not creativity, that's just random stuff happening that only ordinary people would think is creative. Creativity is something truly new and outside of the box, like a sensation that nobody has ever felt before.

Second, the film's message and theme is very millennial (god millennials are the worst generation). The jist of it is how to live even though life has no meaning. It's an obvious, childish conundrum that most people get past when they're teenagers. But of course millennials are stuck in the past and don't know what a purpose-driven life is.

Finally, and I haven't heard anyone mention this, but the film is pitched to you as an epic sci-fi adventure but it actually feels very low budget. Most of the settings are ordinary places (like an office, laundromat, etc) and the weapons, even the futuristic multiverse-jumping gear, are just mundane cheap objects. It felt like those episodes of Community where they played paintball. The movie feels really cheap and thus the multiverse stuff feels like it's fake.

That being said, it's not a bad movie. It's just okay. It is certainly brave, unique, but it's really not creative, it's just random stuff happening, and the overall message is a dead end conundrum only for millennials to struggle with.",7/10,19 May 2022,cordellm1,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),NEGATIVE
Really?,"Take the worst cliches of martial arts films, cross them with the incomprehensible nonsense of the Marvel multiverse, then top with a dash of the pseudo-intellectualism of the Matrix series and you have this mess of a movie.

While watching this with the family, about an hour in, one of us said they'd had enough and the rest of us responded with ""Thank God!"" and we gave up on it.

Just do not understand what others see in this nonsense and am completely perplexed that it received so many Academy Award nominations. That this got nominated for Best Picture while a gem such as ""Living"" didn't just makes no sense.

Rubbish,"Maybe I'm missing something obvious but I thought this was a load of rubbish. I read the reviews before watching and say everyone raving about how great it was. What I saw was the bizarre storyline, characters jumping into parallel universes that were just weird. People in other worlds with hotdogs for fingers, talking rocks or someone with a talking racoon on his head gives you an idea how bizarre it is. The cinema was pretty empty anyway but 6 people walked out after about an hour, that again tells you everything. I stayed hoping it would improve and it didn't. Unless you like these Matrix style, alternate universe style films I would't waste your time.

Peak of Cinema and Creativity,"Holy Moly! Just watched this gem of a movie made by A24, Daniels and the support of Russo brothers. This would be one of those instances where I would like to say best thing I have ever seen in years. I am a big franchise movie fan but this would knock all of it out of the park. It is a low budget movie so of course can't expect like Marvel level CGI or anything but the storytelling and the concepts were the real art about this and yes the acting don't forget that. So, the movie is basically about exploring the multiverse by switching personalities and being everything to protect the end of it from your daughter. Movie is separated into 3 parts, Part 1 being hilarious. I have never laughed as much as I did in this movie and so did everyone else in my theatre. Part 2, is emotional, drama and with epic fights and Part 3 the shortest 5 min with a really satisfying conclusion. The Daniels throw you in a loop, after Part 1 where you think it ends. The movie makes use of simple concepts like maybe wearing shoes on the wrong foot to explore multiverse. Though it might sound weird but it all pans out better than expected. They do follow all the multiversal rules.

The movie also explores sexuality in a sense and inter family relationships and how to look at the positives. A lot of great scenes and don't forget this but the rock is one of the best and the plug is even better. Won't reveal the details. Michelle Yeoh is the best at this one. She is just marvelous and I can't get enough. Daniels makes a rather budgeted spectacle and I think the movies story is why RUSSO Brothers invested in this project.

All in all, a perfect masterpiece. Yes it is perfect.

Funny and emotional with a kind message at it's heart.,"This movie deserves everything that came to it and everything that's coming too. It's many layers uncover and re-cover its characters arcs along it's full running time. If you're tuned into it, it will weave an ultimate message of ""you don't know what you have till it's gone"" that even at the end leaves you with many questions as to the next chapter of their story.

It's a great concept and the visuals, whilst loaded with both CG and clever camera work. Always seem rooted in the universe the movie gradually creates.

What is needed to watch this movie is a willing suspension of disbelief. Don't try to hard to understand it. As I think this will end up being the case if you just let it kinda wash over you.

The cast are excellent. Perfectly selected and directed and play the movie out to its conclusion without missing a beat.

A beautiful exploration of nihilism vs existentialism,"On the surface, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an absurd action-filled comedy about an immigrant family that discovers their ability to travel across dimensions.

Underneath the surface, it's a deeply philospohical film exploring the themes of nihilism and existentialism, and the core meaning of life.

Through its blend of surrealism and comedy, the film manages to make these philosophical questions accessible and engaging, inviting audiences to join the main character on her journey of self-discovery.

This is one of the most beautiful movies and stories I've seen, and it's one to be watched and rewatched, and it deserves every award it has received.

If you watch this film and don't get it, I'd recommend watching one of the videos on YouTube that talks about the philosophy and/or symbolism of Everything Everywhere All At Once. If you still don't like it, that's fine, not everyone likes the same thing.",10/10,14 March 2023,explorer-8272,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),POSITIVE
A genre-defying roller coaster masterpiece with a lot of heart and craziness!,"I saw this in Los Angeles this past weekend (3/27) and this movie absolutely delivers! Such a ridiculously ambitious and awesome film with career-defining performance (in an already legendary career) for Michelle Yeoh. Pretty much everyone was amazing about this film and the swiftness and suddeness this movie jumps around genre and still remain coherent and heartfelt is just a testament of how strong the script, the directing by the Daniels, the cinematography, editing, and all the crafts involved.

It's an ode to so many films and shows , including In the Mood for Love, Kung Fu Hustle, Melancholia, Rick & Morty, Satoshi Kon's Millennium Actress, Scott Pilgrim, 2001 Space Odyssey, Ratatouille, and so many more.

Right after it finished, I already want to watch it again and I just can't stop thinking or talking about it. Best film of 2022 by far!

"Great Effects, Terrible Plot","What a piece of junk. This whole thing is an excuse for a silly Kung Fu movie. One of the worst films I've seen, which took two and a half hours to prove it, with some stupid existential claptrap by the writers who must think that they're speaking genius philosophy. This is the kind of movie that certain people (and the Oscars) say is brilliant just to show how hip they are. I don't get the ridiculous sense of humor, the ""hot dog finger"" people, the bagels and worse, the happy face eyeballs. And of course we just had to have a lesbian subplot. Why, what film is complete without it! And the ever-so-apologetic filmmakers just had to remove the highly offensive but funny ""Big Nose"" from the credits. Wimps. This film actually would have worked better as a regular movie about laundromat owners. What a waste of brilliant special effects.

For those that have seen it, I work in a bagel shop which only made it all the greater. Incredible sound design, plot, message, cinematography, just everything was executed perfectly.

Enough material for 90 minutes,"I loved the casting, acting, and plot. CGI doesn't do a lot for me but I didn't mind as it was necessary to advance the story (for once). But 139 minutes? It was already repetitive after an hour or so. One could argue that ""everything and everywhere"" takes time, or that it should take time--even at the expense of clarity and originality--but either way it shouldn't feel like an eternity. All the martial arts and gags were funny somehow even though fairly unoriginal. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but feel the directors lost control of the pacing and rate of revelation--which was glacial. It also felt like the editors were paid by the screen-minute rather than for doing their job, which is to yell at directors and be brutal for the good of the finished product.

It deserves a 6 for the good stuff, not a 1 for the idiots who kept saying they didn't understand what was going on. It wasn't rocket science, just way too long.

Jaw-dropping,"I made my account just to review this movie. I saw this movie two days ago and I keep coming back to this page to see how many reviews it's received. As of now, it's at about 8,000, which makes me sad. It tells me that not enough people are seeing this incredible movie. From beginning to end, this movie was immaculate. The story was intriguing the entire time, the cinematography was awesome, the editing was out of this world, and the acting was great all the way around. This movie had me laughing hysterically one moment and brought tears to my eyes the next. Overall, this is going to be the best movie of the year, if not the decade. 10/10.

I wanted to love it- was MEH.,"After all the awards hype, I finally watched this mess. To be fair, it was an original concept and for that it was refreshing. The actors did wonderfully with the material.

I just didn't really care for all they crammed into it. I do prefer a linear story and this was not that. So my MEH, is based on a self preference and not based on presentation by these fine actors.

Honestly, not all movies are meant for everyone.

Please give it 15 minutes of your time, before you dismiss it. I think that entertaining the masses is a hard job and although this was my take on it, you should make up your own mind!!

"""I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel.""","Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.

What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.

I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:

Be kind - even if my review isn't.

"Great idea, but this one is not for me","The movie is okay. I get the message. I like the creativity and some dialogues, but in my opinion, it's overhyped. For some it might be confusing, dizzy and unbearable to watch, even to me, I couldn't stand some parts, and I have a very high tolerance towards this type of films. I know the point is to overwhelm and have some funny, ridiculous scenes from all the nihilistic, madness and existentialist plot, but it's not my stuff.

"Paid for the whole seat, but only used the edge","I'll preface my review by first stating that I had mediocre expectations coming in. It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.

1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.

2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.

3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.

This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter.

TOM CRUISE YOU LEGEND!,"This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.

What an excellent sequel,"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.

'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.

The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.

Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.

Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.

A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",9/10,25 May 2022,r96sk,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
"This is slightly different to the other reviews, please stay with me here.","If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.

Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.

This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.

I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.

The truly epic blockbuster we needed.,"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.

Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.

The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.

There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.

Best Sequel yet,"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",10/10,25 May 2022,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
This is why we go to the movies,"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!

"Great Flight Sequences, Cliche-Ridden Plot","I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.

The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.

The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.

There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.

Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.

I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.

So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.",7/10,18 June 2022,Stoshie,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE

"Not bad, but waayy overrated.","Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.

Here is my take and why I think its an ""okay"" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer, younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.

Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.

The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.

What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.

I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.",6/10,24 August 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE
Flying High,"Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.

Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.

Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait.

The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.

The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.

The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.

The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.

The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.

Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.",10/10,29 May 2022,cruise01,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Take note Hollywood this is how to do a blockbuster film.,"I appreciate the first film but never been a massive fan of it so I was not expecting much from the sequel. I was surprised how good this movie was, it's terrific. Also was great to see no woke nonsense and strong characters, thank you Tom Cruise.

This Topped and Outgunned the Original,"See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.

The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.

Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.

What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.

While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.

The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.

If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.

And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.

I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.

Talk to me Goose,"It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.

There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.

Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.

Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.

There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.

First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.",10/10,30 May 2022,kosmasp,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
we get what we hoped for,"Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.

Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the ""Top Gun"" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.

Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.

Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of ""Goose"" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.

The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.

We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.

Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.

Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.

Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.

Clichè,"What is all the hype about? Predictable, seen it all before, formula.

Nothing new here. Slow burner of a movie. Last ten minutes of entertainment.

All the rest is just time filler for that last ten minutes.

Cannot believe the higher than average ratings this movie is getting.

Must be an indicator of how much we have been deprived in the movie department for the last two years!!

All the ratings above seven seem at odds with what is on the screen and the story telling.

I love Tom Cruise movies but this one is not up there with the best of them. Sorry Tom. I obviously am in the minority on this view.",6/10,29 June 2022,ivancampbellson,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE
Puts a smile on your face!,"What a rush. Lucky enough to watch this is on a Dolby screen - a thrilling cinema experience. Outstanding direction and editing. The genuine aerial stunts really put to shame the endless CGI tripe that is slopped into theatres every week. The action here feels viscerally REAL - something that has been sorely missed from recent blockbusters.

The new cast are all perfect. It's obvious they are having the time of their lives - and that infectious joy was felt by the whole audience. Charming, funny, arrogant and heartful at all the right times. I hope we will see them reunited on screen (and much sooner than 36 years!) The nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise does not look out of place. The practical flying scenes really cannot be praised enough. It's an action masterclass, I can barely fathom the work and effort it took to capture such ambitious footage.

The film is self-aware and knows exactly what the audience is there to see. Clearly a better script than the original (although lacking the iconic quotes.) Killing off Meg Ryan seemed a bit unnecessary, especially after they made the effort to bring back Val Kilmer for a quite jarring cameo. Honestly the references to the original were slightly overkill to begin with, but thankfully settled down once the plot got going.

I thought the film had come to a very satisfying climax, then a happy surprise to realise the final act was only just beginning! You can't deny that Tom Cruise pulled it off - a real movie star, in a real blockbuster hit. Oscars for sound, cinematography and editing are surely locked down. Simply the best film of 2022.

Top Gun: The Force Awakens,"Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.

Now the complaint. This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.

Having said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).

Its fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)

"An Unpopular Opinion: Overrated, Overhyped and Aimless","The new, acclaimed and horribly popular Top Gun sequel is just the same boring blockbuster with the latest special effects to appeal to the standards these days. The cinemas will be absolutely packed and the movie will keep striking hits at the box office, but it's just Tom Cruise returning for another 2-hour round of exciting dogfights, poor story and bad pacing.

There is absolutely nothing special about Top Gun: Maverick; it's just a pointless waste of time, especially considering its 1986 predecessor was more even more decent than this movie is. It'll definitely offer big audiences who lived through the 80s with their powerful levels of nostalgia, just like Scream fans would've received a nice touch from the new Scream, which is perfectly reasonable.

This film actually lives with some pretty good direction, admirable cinematography, emotional connections and tamer content, but that doesn't overlap how it turned out. In fact, those are the only perks throughout this movie. The story is overlong and very boring to watch, just after being predictable and filled with attempted elements that just don't work out. Tom Cruise and the entire cast is tiring to watch and the writing is terrible.

Amazing entertainment,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I wasn't the biggest fan of first ""Top Gun"" movie. I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.

Today i saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.

Overall, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.",10/10,2 June 2022,851222,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE

Holy cow such a great IMAX experience!,"Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.

Worth the wait,"Really!! It's amazing how something so good and looked forward to was above expectation. Amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine. He knows what audiences want and he delivers. Not sure how they can top this one (but I thought the same after watching him cling onto a plane).

You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience. Go see it you wont regret it.

Perfection doesn't deserve a remake. It deserves a re-watch.

4. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing. They looked so good.

I so often feel disappointed by hyped up films, but this deserves all the hype, and then some.

Top Gun is a classic, one of those films we've all seen, and many love. When I first heard about a follow up, I dreaded it, so many films have diabolical follow ups, almost damaging the original, definitely not the case here though, this is a great movie.

All involved were outstanding, Tom Cruise, clearly a perfectionist, and that side of him is evident here, I cannot find a single fault.

I was tempted to write out all the issues I had that took away the 3 stars, but this film is really just a fun, happy thing that everyone loves and isn't arguing about, and how often do we get that?

So I'll just say it's worth the watch and leave it at that.

This is what we want. (not politics and social justice),"This is how you do a sequel. Top Gun: Maverick, is a surprisingly good time, specially given the current state of Hollywood. In some ways, it's even better than the original. It's also bittersweet, because it represents an America that no longer exists. It represents the end of an era, in many ways.

Having said that, it's a solid 8.5 for me, and well worth the money.

What else to say? The scenes with the f-18s are beautiful. Specially considering, most of them are 100% real. (no CGI) Tom Cruise, is Tom Cruise. Great acting, as always. Same goes for the rest of the cast. Pretty much all the roles were well acted.

This is how you do a movie. Wanna make money movie companies? Stop pushing politics and shoving social issues down our faces.

More corn than the Jolly Green Giant,"I drove an hour each way to see this in a movie theater, my first visit to one a couple of years because I wanted to get the full cinematic experience. What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor.",6/10,13 June 2022,radhrh,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE

One of the best sequels ever,"Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes a very rare feat of being a long gestating sequel that is not only worthy of the original but actually better than it. Managing to retain the spirit of the original whilst also adding stronger stakes, a more emotionally involving narrative and better written characters.

Tom Cruise is perfect as Maverick, bringing all the charm and star power but also adding much needed dramatic weight and sorrow to the character. He also has great chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, who is a strong love interest with lots of warmth and humanity.

All of the new cast fit in perfectly and are all really memorable but Miles Teller is definitely the standout with a satisfying character arc and has equally great chemistry with Cruise. Val Kilmer's inclusion was a superb decision and is handled with immense love and respect.

Joseph Kosinski's direction is absolutely amazing. The film looks amazing overall with some nice homages to Tony Scott's iconic style but the standout is definitely the flight sequences which are truly astonishing and satisfyingly practical.

Sifting through hours upon hours of footage, the flight sequences are edited together in spectacular fashion, extremely comprehensible and never boring. The film itself has excellent pacing, naturally building to a thrilling climax that just keeps escalating.

The soundtrack and music by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga and Hans Zimmer is also perfect. All the classics you expect are present and used in satisfying ways and the new music is appropriately epic. The new songs by Lada Gaga and One Republic are so good, utilised at the right moments and equally catchy and memorable.",10/10,28 May 2022,masonsaul,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE

A remake that actually worked,"So I can't give it 10 stars because ultimately it is a remake or sequel however you prefer to look at it. It falls into the same traps these films do with too many callbacks and rehashed scenes.

That said, there is a very honest story about changing times and aging which ultimately drives the movie. Good cinema is subtle about real world situations (best example being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. People not watching it when it was released probably would miss all the commentary on politics from the era.) So in that sense it's pretty bold and genuine.

The flight sequences are...outstanding. It was mostly shot practically which is why is looks so much more impressive than other movies. Directing is good, not great (sans the action sequences, which are great.) Acting is great. Connelly, Cruise and Teller are all A-listers for a reason. So anyone who says ""there's nothing good about this movie"" are just haters. You can't by any stretch of criticism say the action sequences and acting aren't some of the best you'll see all year.

It is very much a throwback to blockbusting movies from the 80's and it really feels like it. But we haven't had that in so long, it was nice to revisit it. I don't think it's one of the greatest movies of all times, but I gave it a 9 because it could be the greatest movie from the last 3-4 years. It didn't ask you to have watched a bunch of other movies to appreciate it (like Marvel) it wasn't preachy with its messaging, it didn't drag, it was humanizing but indulgent with drama.

No, but Jennifer Connelly performance is convincing enough, the rest of Top Gun: Maverick is a visually well done film, the movie succeed to make me feel so intense and it's really probably the most intense feeling i got in a non-horror movie, the movie is also surprisingly emotionally moving, Maverick is never been a guy that i was that adored, and as a character a fanatic, but somehow someway i feel like i was know him longer than ever, i feel closer to him more than ever, and i was care to him way more than ever, all the new Top Gun team is as exciting as the previous one and probably even more, Miles Teller is really the second best performance in here next to Tom Cruise, a very very powerful performances by Miles Teller, the music like the first one was great, the score, and of course the whole plane sequence was just terrific, overall Top Gun: Maverick is one of those movie that you have to watch in the theaters not only because it's a great movie but the sound and the visual is a big screen only experience, it's a way better movie than the first one too, i loved every second of this movie, it is truly a very emotional ride, it's a very fun ride, it's a very intense ride, and at in the end the whole movie is a fantastic ride, Top Gun: Maverick is so far for me the best films of the year.",10/10,25 May 2022,HabibieHakim123,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Cruise remains a Top Gun,"Hollywood had lost its way long before streaming services and a global pandemic nearly made going to the cinema obsolete. Content to strip mine the comic book genre and reboot/reimagine and regurgitate beloved franchises, it had become stale and tired. It's ironic then that a sequel to a nearly 40 year old film (You read that right. Scary isn't it?) might be the thing that points the way to their salvation.

Top Gun: Maverick is a totally unnecessary film and on the surface it would seem to be Hollywood once again gnawing on a bone long since picked clean of any meat. The original Top Gun didn't exactly leave us with a bunch of unresolved issues or end on a cliffhanger. Just because a movie is good doesn't mean it needs a sequel. But here we are. And damn if they don't just manage to make it worthwhile, if still unnecessary.

Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same story beats as the original, but the tone here is far less... 80s. Fitting as it's not, well, the 80s. That doesn't mean it's some sort of post-modern deconstruction of the titualar character or a naval gazing treatise. It's got plenty of humor and, most important of all, it isn't saddled with preaching a ""woke"" message or poking us in the chest with some ideological finger. It's a movie that just wants to entertain, and entertain it does.

Whatever you or I may think of Tom Cruise's ""religious"" beliefs, I dare anyone to say that there is an actor working today who brings the kind of passion and commitment to excellence to everything the way he does. He truly is the last real movie star, and I find myself appreciating him more and more with each passing year.

My quibbles are just that. The romance between Cruise's Maverick and the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly's Penny is a tad perfunctory, even though they do share a nice chemistry and Connelly is particularly good. The enemy is also faceless and nameless, likely in an attempt to not offend any particular market; though to be fair this was also the case in the original.

But these minor issues aside, Top Gun: Maverick is a refreshing throwback to a time when Summer films were fun, and after nearly 20 years of increasingly banal comic book, cgi shennanigans, it really hit the spot that much more.",8/10,27 May 2022,Fluke_Skywalker,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Flying scenes good,"Sorry, but I thought this was a boring movie. It was nostalgic, but it was also boring. The flight scenes and action scenes were great. But the dialogue was dull, full of cliched sentences. I don't think the writers on top of their game, and it's a shame because this could have been a very good movie, it needed better writing. Even the music was not inspiring. I don't know why this movie has such high ratings, probably the nostalgia and flying action was truly outstanding. It was good to see Tom Cruise in action again, he is a true star and a it seems he can do anything. I wish he had hired better writers for the dialogue.

What The Cinematic Experience Is All About,"In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to ""get out"" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.

For a very basic overview, Maverick tells the story of the titular Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), still breaking in cutting-edge flying machines with no designs on sitting behind a desk. But in a world that has perhaps moved on from his ways, Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to help train a new class--including one Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whose name may sound familiar to fans of the original 1986 effort--for a seemingly impossible mission. Along the way, he rekindles a relationship with an old flame (played by Jennifer Connelly) and comes to terms with some unfinished business--both emotionally and in the skies.

First and foremost, TG: Maverick is a 10/10 film--and easily, at that--because it perfectly balances the ""new stuff"" with the legacy material. Five minutes in, I knew that Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski had the right formula. There is not a single wasted or boring moment here. Not only that, but the focus is squarely on Cruise's Maverick pretty much throughout (as the title might suggest). This isn't some cheap handoff to a ""new crew"" with Cruise shepherding the transition. This is a down-and-dirty, perfectly planned out melding of old and new.

Cinematically, I can count on one hand (if that) the number of times I've been as enthralled from a theater seat. The phrase ""see it on the biggest screen possible"" might be bit trite, but in this case it couldn't ring more true (I saw it in IMAX format and was completely blown away!). The cinematography is one-of-a-kind, the sound reverberates through the entire theater, and the drama/laughs are palpable throughout. I can definitively state--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that seeing TGM in a theater is better than any home theater setup imaginable. It simply was created for the theater experience.

A final movie-specific observation: the ability of this film to garner tears, laughs, and thrills in equal measure is nearly unparalleled. Everything it does--from re-introducing a legacy character hero, to the airborne theatrics, to the subtle or romantic character work--is crafted with incredible care and precision. There is something here for everyone (another cinema hallmark, come to think of it).

It is easy--and sometimes popular--to write off Cruise's work due to some of his personal foibles. At this point, however, one does that at his/her own risk. Is he now the greatest cinematic star of all time? Unanswerable question, of course, but Top Gun: Maverick puts him in the conversation, to be sure. Without his dogged persistence in making sure this flick wasn't unceremoniously dumped onto a streaming platform, who knows what may have become of it (through all the delays and hand-wringing).

Movies like this one definitively prove that the experience remains viable in the current entertainment environment (both for quality and money-making ability). The future of cinema is still murky, to be sure, but as Maverick himself intones about his supposedly impending extinction: ""Maybe so, sir...but not today"".

"Aerial sequences were great, but lazy plot and story could have been so much better.","Ariel sequences were great, but the lazy plot and story could have been so much better.

I think the problem is that Maverick was a 2D character, and one of those dimensions hung on being young, cheeky and good-looking. Thirty years on only the risk taking fighter pilot dimension survives and so to bring Top Gun back, they borrowed far to many themes from the first movie; Hard-ass superiors, Maverick on his last chance, best of the best, hard deck, cocky pilots, pilot rivalry, mysterious enemy. There is really nothing new here, Even for the sentimentality they lazily just relied on the Goose sub-plot line.

Blah,"I don't understand the overwhelming positive reaction to this film. The writing is so so soooooo lazy. It's like they just thought, ""we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of this part of the original, we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of that part of the original."" It's beyond predictable, reductive, and overly familiar. I get that it's a sequel but this is ridiculous. And Jennifer Connelly - who I usually like very much - is really annoying in this. I don't necessarily blame her, though, I think it's the writing and directing. A real positive though is this: Miles Tenner is perfectly cast.

AIRPLANE III,"Hilariously cheesy but thoroughly enjoyable. They've unashamedly not just included every cliche ever conceived but used them as the basis of the whole thing. Such blatant cheesiness makes this brilliant fun.

What makes this madly and stupidly great is that as the story gets even more preposterous, everyone continues takes it completely seriously. Surely you can't be serious - I am and stop calling me Shirley. It's not quite as funny as AIRPLANE but it's getting there.

Shirley, Tom and the writers intended this to be tongue in cheek, it's too good to be anything else. We're definitely laughing along with them, not at them. Nuttiness aside, it's fabulously put together and the over the top acting from all of the stereotypes, or characters as some might call them is perfect for this wonderful nonsense.

Made with love,"This film manages to portray the best of the characters and the original story.

The entire film is pure nostalgia, which reminds us of the story and characters of the original, but also giving rise to new characters and this new story, although it has many similarities with the original, the creators of this film understand all the characters and the previous film, portraying emotional and very moving moments. Some of the new characters don't get much development, but the familiar characters are just as charming as they were in the original. The scenes involving fighter planes are well done and the sound of them is spectacular, the special effects are very few, which is good, and they are good. The performances are good and can be very emotional.

It is a very good sequel, since it understands the story and the original characters, as well as the emotional moments that are very significant, just as the new story is very enjoyable, this sequel makes us have more affection for these characters and the original story.",9/10,24 May 2022,isaacochoterena,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Better than the first.,"Finally, a sequel that not only does justice to the original but surpasses it in every way. This film is proof that you don't need fancy CGI to make a good film. In fact I think it proves that the audience is sick of computer graphics in general.

This films set pieces and sound design are phenomenal.

And it's not woke, which is such a relief!

Tom Cruise reprises his iconic role as Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell whose naval career in spiral leads him to be re-assigned to his alma mater to instruct hot shot young pilots for a deadly secret mission while also struggling with his demons: namely the death of his beloved BFF by dealing with his angry son (Teller) as one of the new recruits. Filmmaker Joseph Kosinski pulls out all the stops by filming in IMAX with some truly astounding aerial footage with the real actors in the planes (um not CGI'd!) with hairy situations aplenty as well as touch stoning with the original's vibe including a touching reunion with Kilmer's Iceman.

Take me on the mighty wings tonight ....... again.,"I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Top Gun at the cinema in 1986. From a nostalgic point of view, I cant believe 36 years have passed between then and this sequel.

The obvious observation to make is that Top Gun - Maverick is more a homage to the original film and characters than it is a sequel. The opening credits and aircraft carrier scene (with Kenny Logins Danger Zone blaring out) promises a treat but I'm afraid it falls short of expectations.

The major problem is that the wise cracking one liners, over the top egos and amazing soundtrack of the original is replaced here with a paper thin plot, elementary dialogue and minor character development. Even the ""mission"" itself is something these days that would have been executed with technology and without using fighter planes. Its also really sad to see Maverick and Iceman at the end of the road and the general sense that the young men we once saw playing volleyball are now relics who have become irrelevant. There is too much use of the original as a lead in to the plot points and even having Goose's son as a big part of the story feels more nostalgic than it does necessary. Maverick's rekindled love story with Penny Benjamin at Miramar is tender but convenient, (Still working in the base bar after all these years ?) but the character is entitled to a happy conclusion to his story arc.

As an action blockbuster it is really entertaining and with the cinema experience, the aerial sequences are gripping and very well done. Personally I would have liked to have seen more exterior shots during the action rather than facial closeups, but I suppose that was done to keep the characters identified during the chaotic final attack and dogfight.

All in all, Its a by the numbers follow on which probably should have been made 15 years ago or not all. I'm sure part of my disappointment is how much of a pop culture effect the first one had on my generation and that this is a pale imitation compared to it. Six out of ten might seem generous, but I guess I just don't want to ""lose that loving feeling"".

"Very Good...Thank you, Tom Cruise","I would like to give this movie a 10, simply because Tom Cruise brought back something great to cinema. He should receive accolades. Thank you, Tom Cruise.

Finally, a wonderful non-Marvel/Disney action movie; I am so tired of the entire tired Marvel eco-system. We really have to admire Tom Cruise for this accomplishment. And, what he has done for the Armed Services in creating interest for selfless service to the interests of the USA, superb. Thank you, Tom Cruise.

I love watching Tom Cruise in interviews. He's so intense and focused. It is a lesson in drive, determination, and mind over matter. Just exceptional. He's now the guy at the top of my ""who would you like to have dinner with"" list. I really admire him; he's my own age, and I am adjunct faculty at two universities, one of which I teach in a graduate master degree program in leadership.

Now, apart from the emotion of my deserved admiration for Tom Cruise and his stellar accomplishment, I think this movie was a great night night out at the theater. This reminded me of Ford v. Ferrari, a good story that exhilarates. Yet, all in, similarly, a bit forgettable and predictable in the story. That is, when I watch a movie, I reflect on whether the movie teaches me something, or draws out of me some unforgettable emotion. Does it change me, like reading a meaningful book. Consider all the life lessons taught in Godfather I and II, or the seminar one-liners of Jerry McGuire, or the original Top Gun.

So, notwithstanding the unbelievable accomplishment of the sets, and planes, and jets, being crazy great, as the overall movie goes, I give it an 8, because it still misses the character development and relies on the original more than it perhaps should do. Truly, I want to give this movie a 10, because emotions tell me to do it for Tom Cruise, but the movie is really an 8, all in. But go see it on the big screen, it's really great cinema. Thank you, Tom Cruise. Do it at the theater to support the movie-making that Tom Cruise is doing. Great cinema, and not Marvel.

Really, deeply and sincerely, thank you, Tom Cruise.",8/10,4 June 2022,LongTimeMovieLover,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Meh.,"While the beautiful aerial sequences are exceptionally filmed, and edited. The rest of the film is one giant cliche.

The acting, the storyline, script and even underscore all seemed phoned-in to me. My biggest issue is how, once again, Cruise's character has to be overly propped/hyped up, just like in Top Gun, just like in A few Good Men, just like in the Mission Impossible series: his character has to be the best and most celebrated, which I find personally annoying, once again he plays the contrarian protagonists who we have to hear his resume over and over again, the new know-it-all macho pilots, the brooding son of a deceased pilot, the angry disgruntled CO, the underachieving nerd, the over-achieving female J. I. Jane, and of course the hot babe of which our hero has had history with, and has the overly mature teenager. Several times in the film someone's life gets saved in the split second nick of time by improbable actions, that we see coming a mile away. While the film is decently paced, the dialog exchange is slow and lumbered. One thing I DID like was the enemy is faceless which gives it a mysterious element, and a profound look at our humanity and our peace in the world. But aside from that, this isn't a film I need to see twice.

???,"I'm not sure what is worse... The acting, script, make up (dude, lay off the blush) or the fact that (imo) this movie is CRIMINALLY overrated. My girlfriend and I were literally shocked speechless at how stilted the acting was. And we are both fans of the original, so it has nothing to do with the subject matter.

I think the disgustingly high rating is due to the overall ""dumbing-down"" of society in general. Mediocre has become the new high mark and a public that devours TikTok, Twitter and Snap like gospel deserves nothing better I suppose. This is the drivel that captivates the audience that enables ""social media influencers"".

A Cruise of a Missile...,"It's like a modern interpretation of The Dam Busters, but with jet propelled planes and huge thrusters, an impossible road, to deliver a load, with all the courage the pilots can muster. There might be a bit of Star Wars in there too.

A cinematically impressive piece of film making that will probably act as the best piece of recruitment propaganda the navy or air force could ever have wished for. Some solid acting, Tom plays Tom as he always tends to, and the rest of the cast fill the stereotypical roles as required.

I ended up revisiting the 1980s version prior to watching this and enjoyed it more than I thought, and it certainly helped to map a lot of parallels between the two, none more so than the irritating background synthesizer.

The top summer film abundant with human emotion. A worthy sequel.,"""Thirty-plus years of service. Combat medals. Citations. Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years. Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die. You should be at least a two-star Admiral by now, yet here you are. Captain. Why is that?"" Vice Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain (Ed Harris)

Top Gun: Maverick is top of the line defining the humanistic action film that stands not far behind my favorite of the subgenre, The Magnificent Seven. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) returns to Top Gun school to teach the best navy pilots to fly an almost impossible mission and to lose their cockiness as well. The losses he has sustained because of his devotion to excellence are codified above.

Almost 30 years after his peak, when he lost a pilot and now faces the pilot's son, ""Rooster (Miles Teller),"" in his class, Maverick shows why he is the best teacher who was once the second-best pilot in his graduating class. That he thinks of himself as an ""enabler,"" not a teacher, is further proof that he could be the best teacher, an element of which is humility. Indeed, this wildly fun adventure is as much about teaching and learning as it is about heroism.

It shouldn't be lost that Teller also played an upcoming student, Andrew, in Whiplash, where J. K. Simmons plays his tough teacher, Fletcher, much in the manner that Cruise plays ""teacher"" Maverick. Both father figures demand the best, giving no quarter until students master the drill and lose their overweening pride.

The motif most young males come to this movie for is the tough-guy aerial play, and there is plenty of that. Yet, their testosterone represents all human beings, male and female, who want to be more than they are and think battle is the key to attaining glory. This Top Gun shows the need to be humble as one pursues lofty goals, right down to the level of love, where Maverick finds another almost impossible task of wooing back his former love, Penny (Jennifer Connelly).

This humanity-rich drama also comments on the pursuit of excellence and its concomitant demand to be selfless to serve mankind. Additionally, reconciling enemies and turning enmity to kindness becomes the formula for success, right up to a rear admiral, Ice (Val Kilmer), who endangers his own reputation to support his former rival, Maverick, and defeat an unnamed enemy threating nuclear warfare from its uranium hideaway.

And so it goes-Top Gun: Maverick, while dishing out heaps of action cliches, also serves up a paradigm for success dominated by a willingness to overcome pride while also saving humanity. That's tops for any movie. Summer is now officially here with Top Gun rightfully taking top of the box office. Rarely does a seemingly superficial adventure promise the salvation of humanity and save summer at the same time.",No rating,28 May 2022,JohnDeSando,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Good but not great,"When the opening credits started up I thought we were in for something special. The music, the graphics.. wow.

However the movie ended up being a bit too centered on Maverick where it could have focused a bit more on the supporting characters like Rooster. It was also a bit too melodramatic in parts to the point of being a tad boring inbetween the action.

The music was generally great but Lady Gaga really felt out of place. Could've ended on one of the bangers from the original movie to leave a better ending impression.

The action though was intense and had a lot less CGI than current movies so that was sweet to see.

Overall still a good action movie to see at the theater but needed a bit more to be truly great.",8/10,27 May 2022,richy_palmer,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Sequel Much Better than Original,"Thirty-six years worth that of the wait. Tom Cruise returns to his star making role of Pete Maverick Mitchell that is now a Captain but he has not changed his way of doing things hint his nickname.

Those over him like Ed Harris and Jon Hamm both not agreeing on a professional level what he does but seem to albeit reluctantly have a respect for him personally.

He is reluctantly either given the choice to go back to the Top Gun school but as a teacher or face dishonorable discharge.

Slowly yet surely he has earned the respect of the other pilots. Miles Teller as Rooster Bradshaw holding a grudge against Maverick over his late father, Goose Bradshaw's death in the original as the latter was his best friend.

We see a very ill Val Kilmer in a two to three minutes as his former rival turned close friend Iceman now an admiral. It is very sad but very much worth remembering.

Jennifer Connolly instead of Kelly McGinnis as the new love interest and single mother as the one that got away, the former not so much the latter.

Maverick is more married to his job and that is why he never got married nor had kids.

Great support also from breakout star Glen Powell as a pilot named Hangman who is cocky as he and Teller's Goose have a rivalry there.

Movie is dedicated to the memory of the original director Tony Scott, who tragically died from suicide in 2012.

Plot pretty predictable. Checked all the PC checkboxes and made all the main pilots minorities, including one that continuously passes out mid air. Besides a few ""that's would never happen"" and cheesy scenes, it was entertaining.

Flight screens were awesome and Val Kilmer's appearance was really touching.

Geiser-teaser overrated nostalgia,"For of all, this movie is not a sequel, it's a literal remake of Top Gun, nearly scene by scene. It went the Force Awaken route and just stole the script of its originator while adding aging actors to it.

The new characters added to Top Gun Maverick are all dull and uninteresting. The flying scenes are lame and all shot with what looks like a fisheye Gopro set above the cockpit. To ANYONE who remembers watching the original in theaters, don't try to pretend that this is somehow exciting and an awesome movie. It's long, slow, dull, lazy, marred by a terrible script... If this movie had been released 20 years ago it would have been torn to pieces. I think that the way CGI and the woke movement have destroyed filmmaking, anything that even remotely looks like a real movie is worshipped with an above 8 rating.

Best sequel ever,"Being born in 1982, for one reason or another I never saw the first Top Gun movie, even though I'm a Tom Cruise fan and I've seen most of his movies. But I'm a huge Miles Teller fan, so with this duo I had to see It. So I watch the 1st Top Gun movie 1 week before the premiere of Maverick. So I had all super fresh in my mind.

I watched it on the opening night in 4DX and just that was the best cinema experience of my life, better than any roller coaster. But I loved the movie, for me the best of the year, I watched it 6 times at the theaters plus 3 at home and never get tired, Better than the 1.

Thank you Tom Cruise!!!,"Flawless. Pure entertainment and adrenaline.

Watched in 4dx and it was insane. Twice.

I appreciate how mavericks character was a legend and performed like one. Not the typical Hollywood writing ( ie boba fett) where the awesome hero we all love turns out to be useless, old and pathetic.

Instead we got a mega bad ass. That was refreshing.

Great story, great balance of action, not too much or little. Not riddled with politics or social justice.

If Disney had made this film there would have been a strong female lead telling tom cruise he was pathetic with a few mentions of white privilege, and then a few guys making out in the cockpit just to check boxes, and meet quotas.

A triumphant return to the skies,"After not only a 36 year wait but a painful few years in amongst that awaiting the Covid-19 pandemic to be tolerated enough for cinemas to be back open for business as per usual, the sequel to iconic 1986 action thriller Top Gun has finally landed in the form of the much-hyped Maverick.

A follow-up that has absolutely no right being as good as it is, director Joseph Kosinski and his star Tom Cruise have blown expectations out of the water for their return to the high flying world of American pilot extraordinaire Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a talented and confident loner who is still haunted by the death of his best friend and facing a changing world where his kind of pilot is no longer considered necessary in a changing landscape where man are too be replaced by machine.

Perfectly balancing homages to the past that is sure to please die-hard fans, respecting the era in which Top Gun was birthed into, bringing in new characters to Mitchell's world and giving us a story we can invest in while gifting us the adrenaline rush a film like this should inject into our eyeballs, Maverick is a highly functional balancing act of pure entertainment, thrills and heart and while there's nothing out of the ordinary about the story being told in this venture, Kosinski and Cruise's commitment to the cause and ability to be at one with itself allows Maverick to succeed where so many similar ventures have failed in recent times.

To call Maverick one of the most successful sequels of all-time may seem far too over the top but with all things considered there's reason to be so buoyant about such a statement and the fact all involved with Maverick were up for doing things the old fashioned way when it comes to stunts and set-pieces, ensures that the spectacle found within Kosinski's fast-moving and constantly entertaining exercise is one of the best examples of Hollywood filmmaking seen in the last decade, on par with the likes of Mad Max: Fury Road and Cruise's other beloved property Mission Impossible when it comes to bang for buck and top-tier blockbuster outings.

It's extremely rare for a film of this kind to somehow give time and place to all of its components, giving them time to shine and work alongside one another but that's what happens here as the story of Mitchell's grief and desire to find peace with his life comes full circle, all the while giving us a birds eye view of being a pilot in a generation of advanced military machines, culminating in one of the most memorable finales in some time that is sure to have audience members gripping their seats and swaying their heads left and right as the exploits in the skies take hold and Kosinski and Cruise's imaginations come to a stunning conclusion.

Throughout all of this is a collection of memorable performances with Cruise once more displaying a rare ability to possess Hollywood charisma almost unlike any other peer while new additions to the Top Gun world such as Miles Teller as Goose's son Rooster (with Teller looking uncannily like his fictional father), Jennifer Connelly as Mitchell's love interest Penny and Glenn Powell as the cocky Hangman all making memorable appearances while a touching and important cameo from Iceman himself Val Kilmer will be a significantly memorable moment for many children of the 80's.

Final Say -

Old school Hollywood filmmaking makes a triumphant return in the unexpectedly thrilling (and even moving) experience that is Top Gun: Maverick. A significant achievement for its leading man and a career touchstone for director Joseph Kosinski, if there's one film you see on the big screen this year make it this one.

So glad I saw this film.,"I was never anticipating Top Gun Maverick. I thought Top GUn was good, but not great. I couldn't care less about the film, but most people and my friends said it was amazing. So I went to see it. And sure enough, it was one of the best experiences I have ever had on the big screen while watching this, and holy sherbert was this a film to have and has no right to be this level of good.

Pros: Because Rarely do you get a sequel that measures well against a Blockbuster like what Top Gun was. But I have to say, and excitedly, Maverick does just that. I enjoyed the action here, great stunt flying by this highly skilled team of aviators because this action was the best action I have seen in a long time. I take it back because the action and suspense were breathtaking. Never had I wanted to beg someone to make it out of life in the most messed up and dangerous situation. The cast was great; Jon Hamm stood out to me as a big presence. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic; the romance scenes were extremely tasteful and did not detract from this film's core 'action.' The cinematography was first-rate, and the story was solid; the acting was spot on. Jerry Bruckheimer preserved the magic, and There was enough reference material in the movie to remind or retell the original story for those who had not seen Top Gun keep everyone up to speed. Bringing back Val Kilmer was a nice touch as well. The great story they put together to work that in. But Maverick and Rooster were the show stealers of this film; their problems with each other were like a father trying to protect and reconnect with his son. A big plus is that there were more PRACTICAL EFFECTS than CGI. One thing in the modern era where everybody loves to use CGI instead of practical, this was a huge plus for me.

Cons: Nothing much, but I wish there were even more action scenes, as they were all good and entertaining.

Overall, the film was outlandish; they made me like this with some breathtaking action, and I couldn't believe I would skip this film. But I was so glad I saw it on the big screen. 10/10. Perfect.

so much fun to watch,"This movie was wonderful to watch! I don't think anyone believes it's a soul-changing cinema masterpiece, but it was such an entertaining film. Cruise was excellent (and still hot!), the effects were thrilling and super realistic, and the all-over feel of it was just exciting. Such a fun movie to watch.

One of the best!,"I just had to make my first review for this one. I´m 31 years old, and over the years I have tried to rate every movie that I have ever seen to keep track of how many movies I have seen in my lifetime, I´m at 860 titles, and this is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not THE best! Throwbacks, pinched to the chair, uncontrollable emotions, plot twists, amazing soundtracks, it had everything you could ever want in a real action movie! And it still exceeded my expectations. I even got emotional for seeing something that great of creation.

Do yourself a favor and go to the theater to get the whole experience, you don´t want to miss out on this one, trust me! Even my girlfriend loved it and she usually just watch swedish drama films.

HAPPY TO BE WRONG,"I was 14 years old when Top Gun came out. Man, what a great f-king movie. It was great then and it's great now.

Top Gun was peak 80s blockbuster and undoubtedly, peak Tom Cruise. Don't even get me started on Val Kilmer and the beach volleyball scene.

However, for as good as Top Gun was, and again, still is, I was okay with Too Gun being Top Gun and leaving it alone.

Honestly, I had zero desire to see Top Gun: Maverick and even though no one I knew who saw it would shut up about how good it was, I kind of took it with a grain of salt.

That is, until I watched it tonight.

I've never been more glad to have been proven wrong than I am right now. Top Gun: Maverick was as close to perfect as a movie can get. The script, the cast, the soundtrack, the nostalgia, everything about it. My only regret is that I didn't see it in the theater.",10/10,4 October 2022,taralynnemurray,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
"Entertaining, but no big deal","I can understand why this movie is so popular in the United States, an audience that the accustomed to Marvel, Disney World and a lot of artificiality in their lives. I consider this movie to be about a 6, it was entertaining if you didn't think about it too much.

The performances were decent but nothing really stood out, there was not a single performance that stood out, everybody did an adequate job. I must confess to never understanding why Joe Hamm is a celebrity or has the tiniest bit of fame, that's one issue I had with the film. There were a couple of characters that were pretty annoying, none of the characters were well-developed, the writing seemed pretty poor, and on the juvenile side, and Tom Cruise's performance was about on par with everyone else. Adequate, but nothing special, just adequate. I would describe this entire movie as nothing special, just adequate.

The best parts were the aerial scenes, but I don't understand why this film is considered special. It was just adequate. The direction, the score, and the performances were good enough. The two performances that stood out for me, were Miles Teller (as usual) and a brief cameo by Val Kilmer, and the cinematography and production were very good.

Definitely not a 10!,"The flight combat scenes are amazing and there are plenty of them which is great. You really get behind the characters during these scenes. The cheesy acting is as good as i remember from the original, and they only really concentrate on the relationship between Cruise and Teller, Conelly is a bit of a side show. However, portraying american fighter jets as the underdogs when they have a larger miltary budget than the whole of europe combined is laughable. Also, they dont generally carry out operations for the good of mankind. Had they been fighting for oil or resources it would have been more believable.

Underwhelming and unnecessary,"There seem to be an overwhelming number of fake reviews on IMDB aimed to boost theater ticket sales. Unfortunately this highly anticipated film is a typical 5/10 action movie sequel.

The writing and screenplay make film school 101 blunders, like violating the principle of show don't tell. After one ""viewing"", a blind person could describe this movie as well as a non-blind person.

The plot development is campy and over the top, typical of cheesy action movies. The character development is forced down your throat, doesn't work.

The casting for this movie is inexplicably bad.

The number of plot holes and illogical nonsense tends to infinity.

A key point in the original movie was that Maverick is actually a very disciplined pilot who pushes it to the limit of what is required. Notwithstanding appearances, he is actually very considerate of his colleagues.

This sequel completely misses the point. Maverick is now an undisciplined showboating pilot. In a similar vein this sequel, despite appearances, is actually inconsiderate of the original film.",5/10,25 August 2022,ashishagupta,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE
Amazing Movie,"This movie is amazing. Hands down one of my favorites. If you loved the first one you're going to just love this one I guarantee. It's heartfelt and never really leaves you hanging on for too long. The action, adventure, and drama that takes place is honestly just the best. It's satisfying and yet leaves you wanting more or just to simply rewatch it for days. I honestly wish I could watch it as if it was the first time because every moment had my attention from start to finish. This movie has my heart.

What a relief,"The original top gun is my all time favourite film. It maybe a homo-erotic cheese fest but I can still watch it over and over again. It also boasts the greatest soundtrack to any film ever made.

When the trailer popped up on YouTube for top gun maverick in 2019 I nearly fell over. Ive never felt such excitement over a film in my life, I've also never been so scared of a film being bad.

After release I couldn't believe the reviews, I was so happy people were giving it 10 out of 10,I booked my ticket for imax and watched it. When I left the cinema I felt like a kid after you've opened all your Christmas presents, a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong,I was blown away by the film, it absolutely flew past (pardon the pun) and was visually stunning but it just wasn't the original.

I waited a week and today I saw it again,I took my old man who's 63,he's not really a film person but he was loved it. He was laughing,ducking,shaking his head and even crying at the end. This film is without a doubt a 10 out of 10.

If you're expecting a shawshank redemption or The godfather worthy storyline then forget it,that's not what this is. What it is is the best cinematic experience you will ever witness,the flying scenes are stunning,the acting is bang on and it is pretty emotional at times.

This film isn't perfect,it still has unnecessary cheese and the sailing scene is utterly pointless. I would have preferred it to be more serious,I like heroes dying and sad endings but it is what it is.

At the end of the day if you don't see this in a cinema through imax you are missing out. Anyone giving this less than a 7 out of 10 are idiots (it's worthy of that for the flight scenes alone)

Top Gun: Maverick,"In the 1980s blockbuster movies were being redefined thanks to MTV. High octane concepts, rock songs, synth scores, colourful photography with plenty of sunsets and fast vehicles.

Top Gun in 1986 was the epitome of this type of movie which began in the early 80s with movies such as American Gigolo and Flashdance.

The aesthetics provided by producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. Director Tony Scott provided the sheen.

36 years later, the sequel arrives. Dedicated to Tony Scott who died in 2012. This is a Bruckheimer/Simpson production even though the latter died in 1996.

Joseph Kosinski who made the belated sequel to Tron is the man hired to direct this tardy follow up.

Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot on an experimental plane designed to go to Mach 10. He has been passed over for promotion many times because of his rebellious attitude.

Maverick is now regarded as a dinosaur. Under the watchful eye of old foe turned friend Iceman (Val Kilmer.) Maverick is back to Top Gun school.

He has a few weeks to prepare a group of hot shots to undertake a dangerous mission to destroy a uranium plant in a rogue country. The plant is guarded by SAM missiles, hostile mountain ranges and there has to be several miracles for the plant to be blown up.

Maverick does not feel cut out to be a trainer. Especially as one of the pupils is the son of his late friend Goose. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller) is angry at maverick over his father's death and being held back in his flying career.

Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same beats as the original but with a fresh lick of paint. It even has a knowingly homo erotic football scene on the beach.

The mission is a homage to the original Star Wars. Cruise has insisted that CGI is minimally used, the aerial photography is the tops.

This is a fun popcorn movie. There is little that is groundbreaking or new. It is an alternative to the Marvel blockbusters.

Cruise wisely references the original movie with several clips. There was genuine emotion in the cinema to see Cruise again with Val Kilmer who has been recovering from a serious real life illness.",7/10,16 June 2022,Prismark10,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Why Top Gun is a 10/10 movie.,"Top Gun is one of the best movies I have seen because of its realistic scenes, the roles of each character, and its action sequences. In this film, the planes are real and specifically designed for each set which creates a realistic scenery for the audience. Top Gun Maverick builds on the characters from the original to create dynamic charters in the sequel. Each action scene was thought out thoroughly adding vivid details including explosions, plane shootings, and the beautiful background which tops off special effects. As I started this movie I was automatically hooked from the beginning to the end.

Enjoyable Movie,"I don't know if I watched an other movie than the people who praise this to be the best movie ever made. While the action is definitely top notch and I would advise anyone who gets the chance to watch this in a cinema to do so. However the story isn't anything new or particularly interesting. The soundtrack is mediocre and sometimes very corny. The writing is far from great. I think there was an opportunity to make a significantly better movie if they didn't only focus on the action. However it is still an enjoyable movie, but not a masterpiece.

Moderately Entertaining Sequel,"As much as I enjoyed the original, the sequel is simply a tired copy somewhat updated for the times. That having been said, if you are looking for excellent cinematography and great stunt flying, this is your film.

But the times have changed since the original was made. Whereas star power and Tom Cruise's charisma still are worth their weight in gold at the box office, and although this film has a heart, it is lacking a soul.

In times such as these, much more turbulent than the relative calm of the late 20th century, movie-goers should want and expect more from a feature film.

This was simply eye-candy for those who enjoy films pitting the United States against an evil adversary. We all deserve better than this. We need film-makers to produce films that have a soul as well as a heart.",6/10,29 September 2022,arothschild-586-967335,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),NEGATIVE

This movie is overhyped garbage.,"I simply cannot understand all the glowing reviews for this movie. There are maybe two or three short scenes in the entirety of the movie that are any good, the rest of it is, at best, nostalgia-bait and at worst absolute trash. Where to begin...

Let's start with the plot... who are the enemies in this movie? What are their motivations? Based on the mission briefing it seems they're enriching uranium and bringing a power plant online that apparently the navy isn't too keen on... why? What's so bad about this nebulous ""rogue state"" bringing a power plant online? None of this is ever explained, we as an audience are just left to make assumptions that this is bad for... reasons. I mean, that *could* be ok if those reasons were somehow easily inferred but they're just not and because of that the stakes feel entirely non-existent.

Speaking of the mission briefing - I can't be the only one that said ""this is literally just Star Wars and the attack on the Death Star."" I mean *COME ON!* They have to fly a treacherous path down a narrow trench, keeping a low altitude to avoid being shot down, in order to dive in and torpedo a small target before flying out? There are scenes throughout this movie that feel like they were lifted right off the Star Wars Episode 4 cutting room floor. It is absolutely absurd. I'm surprised Maverick didn't tell all the trainee pilots: ""It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.""

Furthermore, the aircraft carrier they're launched from also launches a whole bunch of tomahawk missiles at an airstrip belonging to the enemy that's a mere two miles away from the intended target. Why exactly can't these tomahawk missiles instead be used to take out the target itself? Why send 4 manned jets on a nearly impossible trench run toward the target when you don't have to? Speaking of - why does this mission need manned aircraft to begin with? I mean, the movie starts with an admiral coming to shut down the program Maverick is involved in so he can divert funds to the unmanned aircraft program he would rather be funding - a scene that ends up being entirely pointless because literally nothing about that is ever revisited or even plays a part at all in anything else that happens in the movie from that point forward.

No reason is ever given - or even hinted at - for why unmanned craft couldn't have been used for this, or why they couldn't have simply destroyed the target with the tomahawk missiles they had, instead of destroying a nearby airstrip.

So yeah... I do not care about this mission. The only reason anyone watching this movie has any reason at all to care is if, for some strange reason, they care about these characters dying. But why would we? We're not really given any reason to care about these characters because we spend no meaningful amount of time with any of them apart from Maverick himself.

So let's talk about the characters... we're introduced to about a dozen or so pilots we're told are ""the best of the best"" (told, not shown) and then we get a very basic training montage with them before a handful of them are selected to actually fly the mission. Can any of you who rated this movie an 8, 9, or 10 tell me, without looking it up first, which pilots were selected to fly the mission and which ones were not selected?

I'll even help you, here are their call-signs: Rooster, Hangman, Payback, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Fritz, Bob, Fanboy, Tex, Omaha, Coyote, Rhino, and Halo.

I bet you can name a couple correctly, but I doubt very much you'd name more than that. But don't worry - it's not because you have a bad memory or weren't paying attention, it's just because these characters were boring and barely had any screen time. The movie gives you no real reason to care about any of them apart from Maverick and, to a *substantially* lesser degree, Rooster.

Got your answer yet? Did you notice I added 3 names (Rhino, Tex, and Oxford) that weren't even among the pilots in the movie? Did you notice I left out Phoenix? No? Yeah, that's my point. More than half of these characters should have been *entirely* cut out of the movie so we could actually give the ones that (should) matter some screen time so that the audience has a reason to care whether they survive or not.

Moving on - the entire inter-personal conflict between Maverick and Rooster is contrived nonsense that barely plays into anything at all. What's most disappointing about this is that it *COULD* have been done differently to carry much more dramatic and emotional weight - but instead of using Goose's death in the first movie as a catalyst for their personal conflict, they totally gloss over that and basically only ever use it to tap into the nostalgia the audience has for the original movie. Instead, the conflict between Maverick and Rooster is because Maverick pulled Rooster's papers. It's literally a dispute over paperwork.

I mean... sure - that could result in a serious issue and bad blood between two people. I'm not trying to dispute that - but *WHY* is this how they chose to do that when they had such fertile ground to work with in the form of Maverick's relationship and connection to the death of Rooster's father? Why on earth did they sideline that and use it only for some ""Great Balls of Fire"" nostalgia nonsense? It just makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Maverick's relationship with Penny? This doesn't even make sense. We're given some vague backstory about how he broke her heart in the past - but why then is she so quick to just welcome him back without batting an eye? All he did to get back in her good graces was show up at her bar looking handsome. Heck, if that's all it takes somebody please tell me where I can bump into Jennifer Connelly because I'll be there tomorrow.

I could go on and on about how bad this movie is but this is getting way too long as it is so I'll move into rapid fire round...

The music: again, this is really just playing to nostalgia for the most part. On some level that's fine - it's actually nice to hear the main theme again. Even ""Danger Zone"" was good to hear (although, it kind of felt like they shoehorned it into a weird spot in the movie). But it never tries to do anything new and leans far too much on nostalgia that it just comes off boring and forgettable.

The dialog: ""Talk to me Goose,"" ""Talk to me dad"" - etc. Come on. This is just silly.

The nostalgia in general: As mentioned many times already in this review the nostalgia is played up far too much in everything from the plot to the characters to the dialog to the music to the silly ball game on the beach, to Maverick ""buzzing the tower"" - etc. It's all just too much. A bit of this is to be expected but this sort of thing really needs to be kept to a wink and a nod - instead it was done with all the subtlety of a brick to the face.

Believability: Not only is it absolutely *absurd* to believe that Maverick was able to exceed Mach 10 - which is literally more than *TWO MILES PER SECOND* - but when that plane exploded from the stresses it would have absolutely disintegrated Maverick along with it - there is *ZERO* chance he could have possibly survived that flight, let alone the explosion. This is, ironically, one of the most forgivable issues with this movie though - because it's all in the first opening minutes of the movie and ultimately it amounts to *NOTHING AT ALL* for the duration of the rest of the movie. Cutting it entirely would change nothing.

Anyway, if you haven't figured it out yet, I hated this movie.

Style and substance this time around,"I admit to not being the biggest fan of the original 'Top Gun'. I found it style over substance and that isn't really what I like in a film. Yet here I was on opening night for the sequel. Such is the quality and high standard that Tom Cruise is putting into every movie he is involved in these days. I wasn't let down. This film had the style, but it also had the substance.

Firstly, I thought the cast were really good. Good looking, stylish and charismatic - almost to a fault. It can come across a little arrogant and egocentric, but I think that's what you have to buy into to enjoy these films. These guys are hot-heads no doubt about it, but that's what people pay to see.

There are some very good action sequences in this film. When you're watching a car chase in a movie it is very easy to keep track of where everyone is at. In a plane chase though it is very hard to get context of everyone's situation. It can be a little confusing at times but I thought the film did a good job of keeping us in the loop (so to speak) as much as they could.

There's plenty of fan service to the original. I thought Val Kilmer's scene was handled very well. Touching, sweet, funny and as respectful as it could be. The film is also quite well paced. It's over 2 hours long but it never feels like it is dragging. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie. 8/10.",8/10,24 May 2022,jtindahouse,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
Believe the hype,"I never thought I would see a movie this well made again.

The 2 hours 10 mins flew by and felt more like 90.

Star turns from all of the cast, drama, tension, humour, romance, terrific action, great soundtrack.

The most engaged I've felt watching a blockbuster in I don't know how long. Blown away.

Can't remember the last time I smiled so much in the cinema!,"This was just such FUN! When I was leaving the cinema people were openly saying how good it was and I had to agree. Ok so large part of it don't make much sense, why do they have to attack with such a small force (in a scenario straight out of Star Wars), why not have the rest of the squadron perform flak suppression on the SAM sites? Lots of homages to the first film not to mention 'The Right Stuff' but had to admit was on the edge of my seat when Mav went to Mach 10. Great gag when he walks into the diner in his burnt flight suit and asks where he is only for the kid to reply ""Earth!"". I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch. Speaking of which that was the most emotional part of the film (far more so than all the daddy stuff), seeing Cruise and Kilmer together in a situation that wasn't too far from real life, I highly recommend everyone watch the documentary 'Val' although it is rather heart-breaking. So was it cheesy? Yes, very much so. But was it 2 hours of action, 1980s nostalgia and first rate entertainment? Yes and I would highly recommend it.

How movies were once made,"36 years in the making. Who would have thought it would ever come out. What a spectacle. Plot is questionable but the action is edge of the seat stuff, the opening scene and the test course is hair raising. Cruise makes it happen, even after all these decades he is spectacular. There's a few telling quotes in there about time running out, but fortunately for us it was indeed, not today. Appreciate this once in a generation actor while you can and feel the need for speed.

I've switched my opinion on Tom Cruise (actually a while ago),"I used to think he was a stiff actor, with a lot of forced performances. Born on the Fourth of July was a huge exception, though. I thought he was excellent in that. Even in Magnolia, which was praised, I felt him forcing his emotions a bit. He just wanted it so bad. Somewhere along the line his performances relaxed a bit. His intensity is still there, which is a GREAT thing for an actor to have, but that forced or stiffed quality was gone. He finally just became the cool cat movie star that he is. And now we come to this. Top Gun Maverick. The culmination of all the dues he's paid and all his past performances. This is his masterpiece performance. The quintessential Tom Cruise movie. In all its glory.

Recommended - Great entertainment.,"How many like me, rewatched the original Top Gun before seeing the sequel?

That is often the way to kill enthusiasm for a sequel, but I think this productionprobably anticipated that happening?

Quite something to successfully make a movie that captures the original genre, while being sufficiently different, and modern at the same time, and after so many years!

It does work. So does Tom Cruise and the new cast.

More modern technology, and actor's hands on, make the flying sequences excellent if course. The storyline a little cliched with his relationships but that is also part of the continuing genre.. For me there was a little sometbing missing though and to be honest I can't quite put my finger on it!

Highly entertaining though and presumably deservedly popular.",8/10,30 September 2022,stevenduhig,Top Gun: Maverick (2022),POSITIVE
DETECTIVE BATMAN AT ITS PEAK!,"Detective Batman at its peak! Great storyline. Just as dark a universe as we've come to expect from DC. The gloomy, gritty, dark tone of this film is exactly what I wanted. When you think the movie is over, there's more. Beautiful cinematography. Great score.

Not For Everyone,"I just got out of The Batman

This movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.

This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.

Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.

On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!

I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",8/10,4 March 2022,slightlymad22,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
"Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.","A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.

It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.

Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.

I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.

Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.

Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.

The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.

I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?

What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.

Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.

"Long, yet interesting","3 hours hero movie... It might be quite an adventure for those who expect action-packed movies like Avengers or The dark knight.

The batman is not an action movie. It's a noir detective film.. Just enjoy the dark, moisty mood this movie has.

If you enjoyed movies like Zodiac, Se7en i'm sure you'll love it Go to the theatre immediately.

Everything I wanted and more,"I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.

Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.

The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.

This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.

The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.

Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.

The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.

The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.

The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.

It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.

"Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take","The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.

I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.

Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.

In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.

The Batman Year 2,"Approaching this review holistically as my favorite Batman is Kevin Conroy (sorry live action movies) - my credentials - an average fan, have read most of the Detective and Batman comics, watched most the DC animated shows and movies as well as live action films and played all the Arkham games and also the Telltale series.

To avoid spoilers, just commenting on the actual acting more than plot.

I didn't like the Batman voice but midway through it grew on me. Acting wise Mr Pattinson is impressive (but my favorite roles of his are as Neil, Cedric Diggory and Rev. Teagardin) - as Batman, remember this is Bats in year 2 and Mr Pattinson nails it as well. A fine actor (not better than Mr Keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as Mr Bale..Mr Affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par).

Ms Kravitz was maybe born to play Selina (at least this gritty version). I honestly disliked Ms Kravitz in X-Men and Grindlewald but liked her in Big Little Lies. I was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me, her portrayal of Selina was perfect. Chemistry wise though, needed some work between Bats and Cats but nothing worth losing a star over.

Mr Dano, wow; Saw like sadist perhaps inspired by Mr Spacey a bit, a Riddler far from the kooky ""riddle me this"" we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in a performance no less than his stellar efforts with Daniel Day Lewis. I have become a fan of Mr Dano's acting.

Mr Serkis, just when I thought a re-imagining might go awry, there is Mr Serkis. He portrays Alfred so naturally, it's as if he is Alfred Pennyworth.

Mr Wright is a fair enough Gordon and without any fault of his, once you've seen him as Felix Leiter (as he was the best Leiter for me) it's hard to not compare his take on Gordon with Leiter. Also once you've seen Mr Oldman in and as anything...well Mr Oldman is my best Gordon (like Mr Simmons is my best JJJameson).

Mr Farrell was a believable budding Cobblepot and I hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff (suffice to say I also had enjoyed his take on Bullseye..but InBruges is till my best for Mr Farrell).

Mr Turturro is limited but still impactful as was Mr Skarsgard.

Direction/Plot - I appreciate good work and Mr Reeves clearly put in an honest effort. I enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie. He is not Mr Nolan or Mr Burton or Mr Timm/Mr Dini, but a league of his own and in this, he owned it. Thank you for not messing it up.

Story wise the movie is entertaining and well made - there is a threat, hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day - done quite effectively (not life changing but films rarely are, however storytelling is meaningful). Obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing. Set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly.

Overall - 10 out of 10 from me.

A good movie with occasional bursts of genius in an otherwise tedious film,"This movie wants to be so much more than it ends up being. The tone and color palette are incredible for the majority of the movie until they inexplicably change to a pastel for the final sequence, which is jarring, underwhelming and feels like a sequence from Batman Forever being stuck into a Tim Burton Batman film.

Throughout the movie you feel like you really want to love it, you appreciate the quality of the production, and yet it feels soulless.

The movie is over-long with some sequences being held for so long that I'd occasionally nod off.

Batman is presented as a grounded emo-type loner who patrols the streets looking for signs of trouble, and his eventual reveal as Batman is quite basic. Yes, there is a scene in which he punches someone brutally, but the rest of the fight sequence is pedestrian.

Batman works a case in a noirish setting as a semi-detective who tends to just stand still, brood and gaze intently at things. And Inspector Gordon relies so much on him that one wonders whether the viewer is missing some prodigious detective skills of his.

The start of the investigation into a murder is drawn-out and, again, lacks any real punch.

The Riddler starts off as very mysterious and well-executed. The main issue is that he disappears for the majority of the movie only to leave clues for Batman to solve, à la the Zodiac killer, but no genuine riddles. Once he reappears at the end, he seems to lack motivation for his actions and fails to appear anything other than a deranged child. One can see they were going for a similar disturbed edginess to Heath Ledger's Joker but it doesn't deliver. And his final plot of flooding Gotham doesn't appear to be of super-villain proportions and I failed to see the genius behind that plan. Like... why?

Colin Farrell as Penguin and John Turturo as Falcons are brilliant. Bruce Wayne is too emo to appear as though he has any functioning life outside his mission as either a stalker or as Batman. Alfred is underused and his relationship with Bruce seems aloof. There is one scene at the hospital where the emotion finally sets in and it pulls at your heartstrings.

I loved the backstory of Bruce's father. It was a great addition.

Selina Kyle is excellent.

As mentioned at the start, the finale is a real letdown and underwhelming. It feels like they wanted to do something big for the finale but it just feels tropey. It doesn't feel like a natural place the story would lead to. Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and Tim Burton were great with the final payoffs. This movie doesn't deliver that. It's a mind-bogglingly silly ""master plan"" by the Riddler. And the Riddler loses all his initial mystique in the third act of the film when he finally reappears.

And don't get me started about the silly Joker tacked on at the end. You know the director is aiming for something nightmarishly disturbed and maniacal but it doesn't work. The Joker sounds like Jim Carrey and it's silly that it's him who says ""riddle me this"" instead of the Riddler. And their scene ends with childish maniacal laughter.

Paterson plays Batman well. His voice is excellent and his voiceovers at the start are brilliant. It's just too bad they didn't use more of his narration throughout the movie; it would've worked a treat.

The score is excellent although tends to primarily use the one theme with slight variations.

Is the movie good? Your brain tells you that you are meant to say ""yes"" because there is a lot of quality in the film itself, but the sum of the parts is where it doesn't live up to its potential. It's over-long, poorly paced, with underdeveloped characters and a main villain who shows great promise at the start but ultimately underwhelms and the finale is jarring for all the wrong reasons. It isn't epic in any manner whatsoever although you know that's what they are trying for: but all they deliver is something tonally very different from the rest of the film, and the villainous plan is a head-scratcher due to its mediocrity.

You will watch it once at the theatre and you will tell yourself ""I think it's good but I don't know why. Maybe I should watch it at home when it's released on home video so I can give it another go."" How many times will you watch it? Depends on your taste. Given how slow and long it is, my guess is that I'll only watch it one more time when it's released at home... but even then I'm unsure and not excited by that prospect.

Did they make a mistake by making this movie? Not at all. I'm interested in such a different take and I'm happy it exists and that I got to watch it. It has some incredible moments. But that's it.

Current number of views: 1 time at theatre (advanced screening).

The Disappointing Batman,"Wasn't a fan of Emo Batman. Sorry Robert Pattinson. Film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In the end, the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a run-of-the-mill Superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill. The Riddler was a bit lame too. Forgotten most of the movie and characters already. Underwhelming.

A good Batman movie,"The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.

This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.

At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.

If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme. (1 viewing, fan early screening 3/2/2022)",6/10,3 March 2022,FeastMode,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
The try-hard Batman movie,"Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.

It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.

This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!

The Batman Is A Hell Of A Movie,"Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.",9/10,2 March 2022,HabibieHakim123,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
Gorgeous,"For a hero movie, three hours is a bold attempt; At the same time, with a serious tone of narrative, it is extremely brave challenge. Like 'The Joker', this novel tries its best to create a three-dimensional character; At the same time with a ups and downs of the story, the success of the character image more rich and full. At the expense of course, the other characters are somewhat weak compared to the main characters. And this also leads to some of the emotional depiction is a bit abrupt, which is regrettable. However, whether it is dazzling brilliance, or shocking sound effects, or excellent screenplay, a number of advantages all make this is a high-quality work that cannot be overshadowed by flaws. And as the new Batman Pattinson, also with mature acting presented a qualified answer.

Great Movie - No Spoiler Review,"I was able to see the movie yesterday. So let me start of saying that the movie is amazing.

The tone and the visuals really hit different and it's a different Batman movie than all the previous iterations. Matt Reeves and Peter Craig really are a skilled writer set and the plot, the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written! Kudos to both of them. The score of the movie is amazing! Please do not listen to it before the movie. You need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie. It's full on amazing. Michael Giacchino has perfectly crafted a score for ages. In certain scenes I could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score. It's a very long movie, so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters. I found myself liking the first 2/3s a bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish.

The visuals, fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too. There's no shaky cam scenes, no fight scene is shot too close. And one particular scene had my jaw dropping.

I tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so I kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than I expected it to be. But it's a good thing honestly and I am full on with it if it turns out to be a trilogy. And with that said people will try to compare it to TDK which in my opinion isn't fair because TDK was the second Part in a trilogy. This movie here should be compared to Batman Begins. And to answer the question. Yes I think it's better than Batman begins. And if Matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have a better overall trilogy of Batman!

And one more thing which I find very important. Since the movie is rated PG-13 i would still advise parents to have a second thought about taking younger children to the movies. It's a very dark movie and very intense. I personally think it's even a bit hard for some teenagers who might react sensitive to the themes and scenes of the movie.",8/10,1 March 2022,Shazam1303,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
It felt like 3 hours of waiting for something to happen,"I don't think pattinson makes a good batman and DC just don't seem to know how to make a decent movie its just disappointment after disappointment. I had high hopes for this new take on batman but I found myself squinting at the screen for most of the movie, I couldn't see the action properly! The movie was watchable but only barely.

Most visceral Batman detective Film,"3 Hours run time is totally worth it.

This one feels like a proper Film not a movie.

A well mature dark movie which Batman character deserves.

Robert Pattinson as Batman and Bruce Wayne is the best casting choice after Christian Bale.

It's so dark, gritty, visceral and god damn great.

Colin Farrell as Penguin was Fantastic. Couldn't recognise him.

Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle and Cat woman was great. She was fantastic.

Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, Andy Serkis were great too.

Casting was done greatly.

Batmobile was so f*ing great. When the engine revs, you will get the goosebumps.

Action scenes were absolutely f*ing great. Its loud, bombastic and visceral which will give goosebumps.

Fight sequence were absolutely gritty.

Cinematography done by Greig Fraser is another masterpiece from him.

Michael Giacchino music composition really great. It has that dark gritty grandeur theme music.

The dirty, criminality and madness in Gotham City, you will feel it. It's so dark and grey which Batman character needs.

Production Design is just brilliant.

Story wise this movie felt more to Detective Batman comic book and done outstandingly.

Detective Batman which is the original DC stands for.

I couldn't not find any error in the whole movie.

This is a well made brilliant movie by Matt Reeves.

Totally worth waiting for. Can't wait to see it again.

Highly overrated,"High production value for a very soulless movie. Love Pattinson, but his Batman missed the mark. Too brooding; too lifeless. He could have done so much more with this role.

They clearly tried to make a Batman crossed with Seven and ended up with a mess.

Paul Dano was not a great Riddler. The plot seemed to be headed somewhere, but ended with a fizz instead of a bang. Gotham turning into a shallow water park was not a very evil plan. There was no attempt to make it look as grim as it should have been.

Batman's ""sacrifice"" of cutting the wire to save innocent people from electrocution... what was the point? Didn't work for me.

Not sure how others are rating this up there with the Nolan trilogy, but it doesn't hold a candle. Speaking of candles-most of the scenes in this movie were probably lit by a single candle. If you do watch this film, make sure your ambient lighting is nonexistent.

"Way too long, Pattinson Batman is brooding and sleepy","I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying ""white privileged men"" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious ""woke"" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps. I did like Farrell as the Penguin and the Riddler was basically Dexter the Anti-hero...

Pages come alive,"It was so good! The beginning, the narration, Bruce's voice, his accent, Gotham City, music and sounds... it felt like I'm reading the comic and the pages come alive in my head! It was great! And I live violence, action, crime... this movie has everything! Beautiful car scenes to strong fight scenes to memorable and emotional and dark scenes to those detective scenes... I can't find the right words. You have to watch it.

I was told it's about 3 hours but didn't feel like it. I could easily go on for another hour or more.

And one last thing, make sure to watch it on a big screen because it's very dark and detailed, a movie theatre would be the best place to feel the movie as a whole!

The Emo Batman,"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.

I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.

And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.

I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.

The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.

All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.

Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",6/10,15 April 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
"Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.","I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.

The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.

The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.

'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.

Reeves' even Darker Knight scores in all the right places.,"THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!

The Batman we've always wanted to see!!,"I got to watch this movie early because of a special screening, I was extremely excited my expectations were very high and still they were surpassed!

Robert as Batman is just awesome, majestic and scary and yet at the end, he also evokes that sense of hope Batman gives to the population.

Paul Dano as The Riddler is so creepy! Both Robert and Paul gave an oscar worthy acting.

The rest of the cast gives amazing performances too!

Beautifully shot and the score is thrilling.

It does feel a bit long but it is rewarding.

What's black and blue and dead all over???,"What's the one thought you had when Warner Bros. Casted Robert Pattinson as the Batman? Mine was 'Nooooooo!!!'. I was bewildered on the decision, questioning if this the best they've got for Batman? I didn't hate him but I was concerned if he could take up a big role like this as he doesn't have the regular features embodied by the titular character.

And today's the day I witness myself that I was wrong, Pattinson is a great Batman. Hell, he slayed as Batman! Yes, his features don't really resemble the classic Batman, but he made it his own! This is one Batman that is better than Ben Affleck and George Clooney and audience would compare him to the likes of Christian Bale and Michael Keaton. Also, there's something about Pattinson's jawline that complements his looks everytime he's wearing the mask. He oozes his seemingly mysterious vibe that appears alluring enough for audience.

2022's The Batman runs for about 3 hours long and what's special about this one is it offers a journey that doesn't dive into its origin story, making it a different piece compared to others. It's not centred on 'my parents were killed in the back of an alley when I was a kid', but it takes on a different story, focusing more on Gotham city and its grim corruption happening within.

It's engaging throughout though it's not meant for some viewers because... the narrative isn't made for audience preferring commercial films. I would say the context and story are as rich as The Dark Knight and Joker. If you have a big issue with these two, I mean this as no offense but stick to Marvel.

Like one of those PS4 Batman games, the film offers a bleak and dreary look at Gotham, transporting the audience into a world of transparency and reality. It doesn't shy away from showing us the rawness of the city; the coal-coloured alleys and underground tunnels, the debris scattered on the floor and the hard-hitting fact that no one is safe therefore, audience has an easy time relating themselves with our world filled with arising problems and issues.

If you're wondering Zoe Kravitz did a good job as Catwoman, I would say yes. However, she's my least favourite compared to others who have held the same role like Michelle Pfeiffer & Anne Hathaway. She could've been better.

Kudos to the makeup department for putting on such a brilliant work for Mr Penguin. If I hadn't known that was Colin Farrell, I would not have recognized him even a bit. Farrell did an excellent job as Penguin but there were a few times that he reminded me of Jared Leto's in House of Gucci with the overused accent🤣. And his character was mostly missing in the second half which was a let-down for me.

What a brave decision when they did a 180° turn on The Riddler. They realized that Gotham is a dark place, they changed Riddler into someone darker than what the comic has offered. The Riddler is profoundly menacing and he will remind you of Heath's Joker in TDK once in a while. Paul Dano did a great job but... I felt they could have picked another actor. Prolly that's just me but hey, Dano is 👏👍.

One of the issues I have is the overused soundtrack. For all 3 hours long, rarely you will encounter a scene with no music background 🤣. It takes away a bit of the grounded experience and the suspense that comes from it. If only they restrained the music much more, I believe this film would be scarier. What's worse is the music that was playing sounded quite the same with the next, it comes to a point where I felt irritated by it.

Also, I wasn't impressed by the climax scene. It feels like they are not giving their best shot. It's just not 'ummphhh' enough as what has been hinted in the first two hours. Just when you thought it's the beginning of an exciting final battle scene is apparently almost the end of the movie.

The reason behind this might probably be because of the not-so-formidable villain. Let's take a recent example, The Riddler is somewhat similar to Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die in terms of his capabilities and abilities; they both ace in strategy and planning but weak in combating, resulting in an almost non-existent final battle.

Verdict: As if like a bleak painting canvas sold at a prestigious auction, The Batman exhibits an ambitious look into Gotham's gritty landscape all along strongly coloured with a frighteningly dour tone, illuminating what could possibly be the best movie of the year so far.",7/10,1 March 2022,iamianiman,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
The glorious return of the worlds greatest detective,"For better or worse (mostly better), The Batman is when he's detective first, superhero second. A bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope. It doesn't hurt really if we're having a new Batman film, especially if it took a riveting route like this. Pattinson and Kravitz were explosive together.

Overrated!,"I really don't understand all the love this movie gets. As most of you all have read, there are people out there that think The Batman is better than any of the Dark Knight trilogy or either of Burton's movies and I really don't understand it. Pattinson is horribly miss cast, the story kind of loses itself as it progresses and the score has one good track that is played over and over. I know the director was trying to make this the most grounded and realistic Batman to date but in doing so, he made it unbelievable... what's up with Batman being so accessible and accepted around cops that at times he walks amongst them like he's one of them? If someone really wanted to find out the identity of Batman, couldn't they use facial recognition technology by taking his picture while he's hanging around? The Batman I am more familiar with lurks in the shadows and really only talks to Gordon and other people in his inner circle.

There were some things I liked about the movie...I did give it a 6/10. The set design and the overall feel of Gotham was really cool and made me think of Seven which the director was obviously going for. Collin Farrell as Oz/The Penguin stole every scene he was in, I liked Wright as Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler was extremely creepy.

I have tried watching the movie again and did like it more the second time but I still think it's the most overrated movie to come out in the last few years.",6/10,19 June 2024,eb-47055,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
This is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans,"The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after ""The Batman"" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?

This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).

The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.

This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the ""Detective"" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.

Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8/10,2 March 2022,kevin_robbins,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE

Better Than The Dark Knight?,"This film did exceptionally well on showing Bruce emotional side (partly because of the amazing acting by Pattinson) and had some good character arcs.

We all know that Bruce has a sort of relationship with Catwoman, but for me the relationship between Gordon and Batman stood out the most.

The Riddler is shown as a dark figure and is executed well with Dani's eerie, unsettling performance.

Is it better than The Dark Knight? It is around about the same level, but for some it could be better or worse.

Lengthy and boring,"I went to watch the movie with an open mind and not setting any expectations. The first half had me gripped but there's so many loopholes and bad acting. Batman has the same face throughout the movie, that catwoman could have been avoided (I thought I had started to watch a romantic crime drama). The vilain is quite generic and while the whole cast seems fresh, there lacks a depth in their characters. They tried hard to show things from the perspective of Batman but ended up showing it from a Batboy perspective. Dozed off in the final hour of the movie. I watched it in IMAX for the thrill but the background score and music is just so flat and add no depth to the Batman movies we are used to.

"It was good, but way too long, too slow, and....","This is the only Batman movie that I almost fell asleep in. Even my son was getting a bit droopy eyed. The movie itself was good, but it was unnecessarily long and filled with such a slow pacing that took away from the story. There just wasn't enough story there to warrant the length and pace.

Basically this Batman is detective Batman without much kick some booty Batman. I liked the detective angle, but the solve was pretty basic and in the end was inconsequential. (Sort of spioler warning) - Batman could have stayed home, done nothing, and in the end it would all likely ended the same. So what was the point of this three hour movie?

Neo-noir and Batman at their best.,"""It's a big city. I can't be everywhere."" Batman (Rob Pattison) A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.

Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.

Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.

Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.

The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:

To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: ""They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows."" Batman.",No rating,4 March 2022,JohnDeSando,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
"""They think I'm hiding in the shadows. But I am the shadows.""","This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the ""Gotham"" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in ""Gotham"" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).

All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with ""Jurassic Park"". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.

This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.

Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.

I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the ""Gotham"" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.

This movie could be better.,"I was so hyped about The batman when it came out and i started watching it, the beginning part was amazing but then the movie had no lights so i had no clue what was going on, the pacing was way too slow and it was a 3 hour movie, and most of the movie Batman was at the club so we didnt really see his bruce wayne side and Bruce looked like an emo.

Best Superhero movie,"It is probably the best movie in the superhero genre.

Nothing comes close. Everything is top notch from acting to direction and music. Matt Reeves is a legend and so does Robert Pattinson. Paul Dano was fabulous but my favourite was Colin Farrell. Man he was great.

Finally turning into the Bat(man),"I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.

But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.

All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.

I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times ""alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?"") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.

There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.

But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.

The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.

And then there is the sound system ... I watched it in Imax too, though it doesn't seem to have been filmed with an Imax camera. Still bigger screen so all good. But the sound ... wow! Just wow - incredible.

So while I still feel that The Dark Knight is a bit better - this comes as close as they get. Coincidences and convenient timing aside. Because a lot of things have to go right (or wrong depending on your perspective) for the movie and the story to work ... still small and minor ""flaws"" like that aside - because that should not stop you from enjoying this very well made movie.

Edit: Since this is not an origin story, but still the beginnings of Batman, he is not invincible and he may not have every gimmick/toy/car/vehicle you may expect him to have. There is one truly great car chase though ... I personally would not compare it to the real great ones you may have seen (Bullit, French Connection and so forth) and just see it as a thing that works on its own. Also the added bonus - after credits ""scene"" - is really not something that many will think worthwhile ... as in worth staying and watching the credits through to get this ... well let's call it easter egg, that is not really a scene, but a callback to a scene from earlier ... with a promise for the future one may say. Still you can google it and it probably will have the same effect as if you watched it ""unfold"".

Batman is back,"You've seen a million Batman movies, but you still need to steel yourself for the darkest Dark Knight yet. Starring Robert Pattinson as DC's Caped Crusader, 2022's new movie The Batman is an intense, apocalyptic cinematic experience. Following the famous murder of Bruce Waynes parents, Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime. As Batman unpicks the cryptic clues, the investigation peels away a greater conspiracy. But the real riddle is how the ranting killer's twisted motive ties back to Batman himself. He Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie, Christopher Nolan's criminal politics and Zack Snyder's operatic brutality, plus the standalone Joker movie's psychological backstory, vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony. Most of all, The Batman is a straight up horror film. This new flick is PG-13, but it's on a whole other level from the relatively bloodless Dark Knight movies -- and on a different planet from any Marvel film -- immersing you in a nerve-shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty, and dark touches, and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents. You absolutely 100% can't show The Batman to a child, it will give them nightmares, and bad thoughts. Robert Pattinson's batman is lank-haired mess, and is a world away from Christian Bales outstanding professional look. This darkest Dark Knight may not be for everyone (and certainly not kids), but it's a gripping and nerve-shredding Bat-thriller. The one thing that Matt Reeves explores that Christopher Nolan doesn't is how dark and how can he make it to the story, and comic, and even a horror movie. The Batman should have been rated R not PG-13 because how intense, Dark and scary it is. The soundtrack was done by Michael Giacchino, its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for Batman and Selina, as well as pre-existing music ranging from classical pieces to Nirvana, provides tonal variation to ensure that The Batman never becomes a punishing downer. Go watch The Batman on March 4, 2022 at your Regal theater.",10/10,2 March 2022,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
Overhyped,"Too many glaring issues with this batman movie. But there are good elements on it. I couldnt get past that batman got knocked out and nobody took off his mask. Are all gotham cops idiots?

Worst batmobile ever. There is a certain disconnect to the technology of this world of gotham. He has got a high tech remote contact lens but cant be bothered to get a decent batmobile that wasnt a modified production car? I get that this is probably his first batmobile, but still, he could at least modified it to be a canopy instead of the stock door.

Batman and alfred's relationship feels forced. Especially the bonding scene.

Batman and selina's romance feels forced.

Batman is too lanky and careless in a sense that he is not careful with how he conducts as a vigilante

The theme cant stop reminding me of star wars imperial march.

Penguin sounds like robert deniro?

Pattinson overall is just not a great batman, just an ok batman, probably would make a great robin

batman as a symbol of hope? Get outta here. That's supes and wonderwoman's job

Now for the good elements. I love jeffrey wright as james gordon, i love zoe as selina. I like paul danos riddler but the moaning is abit too much

i like how they make batman's footsteps resound like it is heavy with vengeance!

I like the detective work except for that one part where he tried to use the floor as his ""investigation"" board. Abit overboard.... sorry for the pun

I like the humor. And thats it. The rest of the movie is like it's trying to aim for a real world batman like it's trying to be a todd philips joker, but it doesnt make sense.",6/10,9 March 2022,erilaurence,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE

Fine but was it really needed?,"I enjoy superhero movies and was looking forward to this one but at three hours, it's about one hour too long, Gotham City looked amazing and Robert Pattinson did fine as Batman but the film was largely so dark and dreary that I found myself drifting off at points.

It wasn't a bad film but I found myself asking, after the amazing legacy of the Dark Knight films, ""what is the point of this one?'.

"Not my favorite Batman movie, but a solid one","Greetings from Lithuania.

""The Batman"" (2022) for me personally was not as entertaining as Christopher Nolan's take in ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. If i would compare this movie to Nolan's series, it would be more close to ""The Dark Knight"". That said i liked ""The Batman"" for its being very faithful adaptation of Batman universe itself. I saw two or three DC' animated Batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other Batman movie ever made.

""The Batman"" (2022) is a very dark movie, and i mean that in every way. In a whole 3 hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time. And 98% of the film is set during night, and looks like in Gotham it is always raining. It is a very gritty and down to earth setting, and that i liked about it. The atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of ""Se7en"" (1995). Performances were good and Robert Pattinson was a superb as Batman. Yet i think it was Zoë Kravitz who stole the show.

Overall, ""The Batman"" (2022) is a dark, gritty and very down to earth adaptation of Batman. For younger audiences who grew up on watching Marvel movies (no offence - i really enjoy them as well) this adaptation of Batman will be a test of patience - this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of ""Joker"" (2019) more then any other comic book movie. In its running time 3 hours this movie did drag here and there, but as a whole package it really worth seeing. Not my favorite Batman movie, but a solid one.",8/10,4 March 2022,851222,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
Overrated. Nolan has raised the stakes too much.,"A lot of hype, but the end result disappointed me.

It's not a bad movie. For me, it's mediocre.

With that big a budget; the music is not good enough, the story is all over the place and the running time too long.

Andy Serkis is a good actor, but a terrible cast for Alfred.

The way Batman was presented in this movie, I came to think, why isn't he just a cop after all?

The cinematography and sound design are 2 things that stood out for me.

Was I entertained?

I slept, I looked at my phone and my watch more than 10 times, impatiently waiting for it to end. No.

Would I recommend it? If it were a 6-part miniseries on Netflix, definitely.

For a cinema experience, no.",6/10,20 March 2022,nickeron,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
Forgettable ... And that's a good thing,"I watched that movie like a month or so ago, I'm really having a hard time remembering much about it, I can hardly remember any master scene, interesting plot twist or even an action scene tense enough to stick in your head. Aside from the Riddler I can't even remember the other villains' names!! I mean you can never forget fight club's reveal scene, Forrest Gump's runs & accent, all Heath Ledger's Joker scenes .. etc , u see where I'm getting here?

It's an uneventful movie, a time burner at best. Probably my main issue with it is that I think of Christopher Nolan's trilogy as the bar for any superhero movie there is while this one is attempting a heavy burden of running with Nolan's legacy in its fanbase's minds - yes, Ben Affleck didn't happen for me - and to be honest everything here pales into comparison. I liked how they tried hard to keep the Batman grounded to a realistic human view of the hero's abilities and resources and that's always a great thing for me personally, I get detached from the story otherwise but I think they overdid it to the exctent it de-glorified Batman, I mean aside from the worse casting, the slow story and the meh production, even the little details like the suit, his ugly shoe are noticeably bad!! And my God did they trash that batmobile!!

For me it's a good thing we won't remember much of it a few years later.",5/10,17 June 2022,hazemhassanein,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
The best batman movie ever!!!!!,"First of all the cast is amazing everyone thought why Robert and now all of them see why he's a great actor The movie is scary like a thriller I love it And it's so dark and creepy how Gotham is supposed to be!! Gotham is a sick place and was portrayed perfectly People say the movie is too long but I think it's perfect because then I get to enjoy the movie even more.

And let's not forget the riddler he's riddles, he's costume and he's voice are so scary I love it I'd go as far as to say that this might just be the best movie of 2022 and if you don't enjoy it there is something wrong with you!

Another step towards DC's Unique Path,"As director Matt Reeves repeatedly emphasized in several interviews before its release, ""The Batman"" is a detective noir with a dark atmosphere from beginning to end. If you look at scenes reminiscent of David Fincher's Se7en, the appearance of corrupt Gotham City's public power, politicians, and mafias, you also can enjoy this film as a crime drama. Godam City's gloomy appearance, created by director Matt Reeves, is fantastic. Thanks to the ability of Greg Fraser, the cinematographer of ""Rogue One"" and ""Dune,"" the overall visual beauty of ""The Batman"" is next level compared to average superhero movies. The script written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig is also commendable. As soon as the movie begins, it welcomes the audience with an event that lays out the main plot of the film. Despite the 176-minute running time, which is nearly three hours long, there is no useless scene. It boldly omits Batman's origin and presents a young Batman who has only been active for two years. It feels as if Reeves is responding to criticisms imposed on Zack Snyder's Batman, such as ""He did not make good use of Batman's detective aspect"" and ""Batman is a murderer in this"". Reeves emphasizes Batman's 'Detective' identity as much as possible and shows the philosophy of ""not using a gun"" through dialogue and action.

It does not make mistakes that ""Batman v. Superman"" made, such as packing too much storyline in the movie, or being too focused on setting up the sequel.

Director Matt Reeves have teased a potential sequel, but at the same time, he argued that the first film should be able to work & stand on its own. Director Reeves' work, The Batman, succeeded in creating an impressive work with the story of Batman's growth, relationships with new characters, and Ridler's murder game. Warner Brothers, who had to go through a lot of critical or commercial failure due to excessive interference in the production of films such as Justice League and Suicide Squad, turned to guarantee the freedom of creators as much as possible. As a result, a work that reveals Matt Reeves' ambitious vision was born.

Over the past few years, DC has disappointed a lot of people, and it is also true that it has become difficult to see DC go up to the same position as Marvel and compete with them. However, recently, films such as ""Joker"" and ""The Suicide Squad,"" masterpieces that utilize DC's unique personality and creator's vision have appeared, and ""The Batman"" seems to have no problem standing next to it. I hope that Matt Reeves will be able to complete a trilogy that utilizes his vision safely without following the path of SnyderVerse. Now DC has found its own way, not just copying Marvel. And ""The Batman"" is another step toward that path.",8/10,1 March 2022,imxhill,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
AMAZING,"A true detectie Batman movie. In my opinion best comic live action movie of all time. Just wow. Other hand when I saw reviews from some strange people of metacritic and rotten i was in shock. Most of the negative reviews are about how darkness and depressing this film is. For duck sake, this is film about THE BATMAN, not frinendly Spiderkid fan service movie. A truly i can recommend this film to overyone who likes comics/drama/detective movie.

TOTALLY GOAT OF ALL TIME.

Too long,"First of all, I'm huge fan of Nolan's batmans. The Batman tries to top them, but it fails.

The movie is almost 3 hours for no reason! It just gets boring, the story and the characters are not so complex, so it could be complete in less than 120 minutes.

There is no Bruce Wayne in the movie. The batmobile is a joke. The score is hit or miss and it misses too often.

The direction the movie takes is a good one -Batman is more detective and I understand that it needs to be dark, but did you forget to bring lights on the set?

Nothing against the twilight guy, but in my mind, Batman is not weak emo kid!

The main villain tries to top Heath ledger's joker, but it fails.

Overall it is an ok Batman movie, but it tries too hard to be much more and it is bad for it. Too slow and pretensious and not entertaining enough.",6/10,5 March 2022,Tyler_Durden-BG,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE

Not my Batman,"Overall disappointing movie. It didn't give me chills, nor goosebumps. The approach is somehow bold and visually it had his momemts. For example: the introduction of the Batman and the first shot of the Batmobile.

But the movie has a pace issue, the score is annoying and Bruce Wayne has no flair or style as Gotham's prince.

I tried to avoid the comparison with the excellent Dark Knight, but in the end I catched myself thinking I better could've stayed at home and watch Nolan's piece of art for the 100th time.

Maybe DC should've waited longer to bring back yet another attempt to bring back the 'Batboy'.

WORTH THE WAIT!!,"I had been waiting for this film ever since I saw it's first teaser trailer at the DC fandome in 2020. Now that it's out and I've watched it, I gotta say, it's been well worth the wait. This movie is just a BLAST from start to end.

Possibly the darkest batman movie ever, even more so than the dark knight. Loved Robert Pattinson as Batman but it's Paul Dano who gave me the chills every scene he was in. Colin Farell's Penguin has a lot of potential to be a great antagonist in future films. I would love a sequel for this film

Also, do these negative reviewers think they can drop the rating of the film just by saying nonsensical things like why is the film so dark? 3rd act really boring and all that stuff?? I'd advise you grow up, cause Batman films are supposed to be dark.

Extraordinary,"Yes, it may be the billionth Batman film in recent memory- but The Batman is easily among the best, if not the best, Batman films ever made. Everything works in this movie, and I mean everything. From the cinematography, to the visuals, set direction, score, acting, direction, writing- it never fails, and it never lets up. There are a few tiny predictable things here and there, but none really take an impact on the quality of the movie, nor the story its telling. It is 3 hours long, but the runtime passes fast, and honestly I never wanted it to end. Robert pattinson is just fantastic in this film, a Batman for the ages, and honestly my favorite film adaptation of the character yet. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, Jeffrey Wright bringing a new layer onto the character of Commissioner Gordon, as well as zoe Kravitz with her excellent portrayal of Selena Kyle (aka Catwoman). It's Paul Dano's Riddler that really takes the film by storm however, easily delivering the best villain performance in a superhero film in recent memory, whose zodiac style roots really intensify a new look to the iconic character. Colin Farrell is also excellent as the Penguin in the film, and I hope we get to see more use out of him in the future. Perhaps the most signature thing about this film is the look, a bleak and gritty look into Gotham's underworld, that really does- as director Matt Reeves said- push the limits of a PG-13 film. The look of the film is just outstanding and its hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy is just wonderful to watch on screen- everything a true Batman fan would ever want. Not to mention the action and fight scenes throughout this film are just brilliant, easily breaking new ground, and capitalizing on its darker tone. In the end, I don't have enough words to say how much I loved The Batman. Again and again one word comes to be to describe it, extraordinary. It may seem familiar, but it's unlike anything you've seen before, and in the days of superhero movies- that's something really freaking rare.

Can't escape the weight of expectations,"There is a lot to like about the new Batman film. The sound design, cinematography, and the fight and stunt choreography are its strongest aspects. But after nearly three hours, I'm left both exhausted and disappointed. The soundtrack grows repetitive, as does the film's unrelenting dark tone. And above all else... quite frankly, very little stands out here, very little that isn't executed, in my eyes, much better in the Nolan trilogy. The performances, from Gordon to Alfred to Batman himself, aren't memorable enough, aren't engaging enough to keep the audience invested and to let go of the versions of these characters they've grown to know and love from the Nolan trilogy.

The Batman is not a bad film. It does have plenty of excellent scenes and moments. But it fails to break any new ground and distinguish itself from previous Batman entries.

Also, the Batmobile is a letdown.

Literal Perfection,"Can't say much since this is spoiler free, but that was hands down the greatest comic book movie of all time. Definitely the most comic accurate Batman, and the grounded realism of this film made it ten times better to watch. We really need more of these dark and gritty movies from DC, this is what they're good at. Gotta hand it to Matt Reeves, this was an absolute masterpiece. Robert Pattinson and Paul Dano delivered excellent performances as the Batman and the Riddler, best performance by a comic book villain since Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.

Not worthy,"It's not a bad reboot, but the story is not worthy of the 3 hours. Pattinson delivers a good detective Batman but a forgettable Bruce Wayne. TDK still reigns supreme.

The Batman - an Analysis,"First of all, let's all agree that Pattinson is a good actor. However, this does not mean that every good actor can impersonate any fictional character. Some fictional characters require certain traits that need to be present in the actors that portray them. Batman is one of the darkest, toughest, meanest, manliest, scariest, most well-built, most brutal, most deeply voiced, smartest, best strategy making characters that have ever been created. In other words, Batman is the ultimate human male (without superpowers). Such features are simply not present in Pattinson, genetically speaking. On the contrary, his genetic features are somewhat feminine. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it simply is the opposite of the character's profile. No matter how tough he may try to sound, how much muscles he puts on and how much steroids he ends up injecting in his system, he simply does not fit the profile. To put things into perspective, let's ask a question. Can Pattinson portray the Punisher? The answer is a simple and plain ""NO!"" Why? Because he simply doesn't look tough enough! Batman is the punisher on cosmic steroids. He's way tougher, smarter, stronger, and darker. The reason people sometimes overlook this fact is because of Batman's moral code. So if Pattinson can't even portray the Punisher, how the heck do you cast him as the Goddamn Batman?!!

Even though the movie was trying too hard to convince the viewers that this Batman was intimidating, well, ""spoiler alert"", he's not! Not even a little bit. In some scenes, you actually feel sorry for the character, which is such a shame. Of course, the main reason behind this is that the guy who's playing the character isn't. Not only did Batman lack brawn in the movie, he also lacked brains! Everybody's talking about how this movie perfectly portrays Batman as ""the world's greatest detective"". Sorry guys, but if this is what ""the world's greatest detective"" looks like to you, you should definitely read more Batman comics and maybe some Agatha Christie books too. I mean, seriously, the guy had no clue what a carpet tucker was! How the heck are people even comparing the detective work in this movie to Se7en? What was presented here wasn't even the ABCs of detective work. It was pathetic, and Batman was slightly less of an idiot than the cops around him. His suit overall was not good. He literally looked flat in it. I liked the fact that it's bullet proof, but that's about it. The cowl is the worst thing about it. It's cheap, too revealing, and makes Batman's head look like an Easter egg! I really liked the camera lenses though; that was a brilliant addition. The adrenaline shot was a good idea too. It makes total sense, and I can't remember it ever being used on the silver screen. The batmobile was another thumbs up. But wait, I have to talk about the stupid point of Batman using the front door! I mean, seriously, what the hell was Reeves even thinking? Batman is the world's greatest ninja. If he wanted to get into someplace he wasn't welcome, he'd sneak in, get whatever he needed and leave without anyone ever noticing!

Believe it or not, Catwoman's casting in this flick was a much better choice than Batman's! Zoe almost fits the character's full profile. She's agile, flexible, mysterious, seductive, with sharp exotic features. Maybe a bit too exotic, but that isn't really an issue. The real issue with her is that she's too small and thin, which makes her look too fragile against her foes, making her fight scenes seem unrealistic to the viewers. But I guess they had to cast a tiny actress for the role, especially since the dude who's playing Batman is a whimp.

Colin Farrell as the Penguin. Wow! Just wow! This guy took the character to a completely new level. I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite Penguin adaptation ever. Maybe even better than the comics! Farrell's acting is so good, it makes you forget that he's actually playing the character. Turturro's Falcone was spot on too. They both looked like they came straight outta The Godfather!

I don't usually like it when they change anything about a comic book character, such as their ethnicity, simply because I like the live-action representation of the character to be as close to the comics as possible. But in Wright's case, I'm actually glad they did. He simply nailed the character.

Now let's talk about the movie. The cinematography was really good and I really liked the film's noir theme. The score was amazing too, which added more depth to the movie's theme. Reeve's direction was good, but had its flaws. The script was very basic and lacked layers of depth. Paul Dano as The Riddler and Andy Serkis as Alfred were decent, but nothing special. The movie's runtime was way too long (it should've ended at least 30 minutes earlier). And then there's the ending.. that stupid motorcycle race between Batman and Catwoman looked like something out of a cheap Indian movie. Not even cartoons do that anymore!

Weak Villians and weaker Batman,"How does this fly for a Batman movie? The Villians were quite poor and weak through the entire movie. Batman plays 100% into one of the Villians hands and helps destroy Gotham? Some detective he turns out to be. The ride out ending of the two characters... come on how can WB waste so much of the DC content. Super poor casting here. Batman looks like he is on drugs and is a wimp. His gadgets are super DIY and clunky. The sets and cinematography are the only good parts of the film.

Not For Everyone,"I just got out of The Batman

This movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.

This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.

Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.

On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!

I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",8/10,4 March 2022,slightlymad22,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE
"Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.","A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.

It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.

Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.

I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.

Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.

Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.

The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.

I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?

What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.

Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.

"Long, yet interesting","3 hours hero movie... It might be quite an adventure for those who expect action-packed movies like Avengers or The dark knight.

The batman is not an action movie. It's a noir detective film.. Just enjoy the dark, moisty mood this movie has.

If you enjoyed movies like Zodiac, Se7en i'm sure you'll love it Go to the theatre immediately.

The Batman Year 2,"Approaching this review holistically as my favorite Batman is Kevin Conroy (sorry live action movies) - my credentials - an average fan, have read most of the Detective and Batman comics, watched most the DC animated shows and movies as well as live action films and played all the Arkham games and also the Telltale series.

To avoid spoilers, just commenting on the actual acting more than plot.

I didn't like the Batman voice but midway through it grew on me. Acting wise Mr Pattinson is impressive (but my favorite roles of his are as Neil, Cedric Diggory and Rev. Teagardin) - as Batman, remember this is Bats in year 2 and Mr Pattinson nails it as well. A fine actor (not better than Mr Keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as Mr Bale..Mr Affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par).

Ms Kravitz was maybe born to play Selina (at least this gritty version). I honestly disliked Ms Kravitz in X-Men and Grindlewald but liked her in Big Little Lies. I was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me, her portrayal of Selina was perfect. Chemistry wise though, needed some work between Bats and Cats but nothing worth losing a star over.

Mr Dano, wow; Saw like sadist perhaps inspired by Mr Spacey a bit, a Riddler far from the kooky ""riddle me this"" we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in a performance no less than his stellar efforts with Daniel Day Lewis. I have become a fan of Mr Dano's acting.

Mr Serkis, just when I thought a re-imagining might go awry, there is Mr Serkis. He portrays Alfred so naturally, it's as if he is Alfred Pennyworth.

Mr Wright is a fair enough Gordon and without any fault of his, once you've seen him as Felix Leiter (as he was the best Leiter for me) it's hard to not compare his take on Gordon with Leiter. Also once you've seen Mr Oldman in and as anything...well Mr Oldman is my best Gordon (like Mr Simmons is my best JJJameson).

Mr Farrell was a believable budding Cobblepot and I hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff (suffice to say I also had enjoyed his take on Bullseye..but InBruges is till my best for Mr Farrell).

Mr Turturro is limited but still impactful as was Mr Skarsgard.

Direction/Plot - I appreciate good work and Mr Reeves clearly put in an honest effort. I enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie. He is not Mr Nolan or Mr Burton or Mr Timm/Mr Dini, but a league of his own and in this, he owned it. Thank you for not messing it up.

Story wise the movie is entertaining and well made - there is a threat, hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day - done quite effectively (not life changing but films rarely are, however storytelling is meaningful). Obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing. Set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly.

Overall - 10 out of 10 from me.

The Disappointing Batman,"Wasn't a fan of Emo Batman. Sorry Robert Pattinson. Film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In the end, the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a run-of-the-mill Superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill. The Riddler was a bit lame too. Forgotten most of the movie and characters already. Underwhelming.

A good Batman movie,"The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.

This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.

At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.

If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme. (1 viewing, fan early screening 3/2/2022)",6/10,3 March 2022,FeastMode,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
The try-hard Batman movie,"Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.

It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.

This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!

The Batman Is A Hell Of A Movie,"Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.",9/10,2 March 2022,HabibieHakim123,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE
Gorgeous,"For a hero movie, three hours is a bold attempt; At the same time, with a serious tone of narrative, it is extremely brave challenge. Like 'The Joker', this novel tries its best to create a three-dimensional character; At the same time with a ups and downs of the story, the success of the character image more rich and full. At the expense of course, the other characters are somewhat weak compared to the main characters. And this also leads to some of the emotional depiction is a bit abrupt, which is regrettable. However, whether it is dazzling brilliance, or shocking sound effects, or excellent screenplay, a number of advantages all make this is a high-quality work that cannot be overshadowed by flaws. And as the new Batman Pattinson, also with mature acting presented a qualified answer.

Great Movie - No Spoiler Review,"I was able to see the movie yesterday. So let me start of saying that the movie is amazing.

The tone and the visuals really hit different and it's a different Batman movie than all the previous iterations. Matt Reeves and Peter Craig really are a skilled writer set and the plot, the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written! Kudos to both of them. The score of the movie is amazing! Please do not listen to it before the movie. You need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie. It's full on amazing. Michael Giacchino has perfectly crafted a score for ages. In certain scenes I could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score. It's a very long movie, so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters. I found myself liking the first 2/3s a bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish.

The visuals, fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too. There's no shaky cam scenes, no fight scene is shot too close. And one particular scene had my jaw dropping.

I tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so I kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than I expected it to be. But it's a good thing honestly and I am full on with it if it turns out to be a trilogy. And with that said people will try to compare it to TDK which in my opinion isn't fair because TDK was the second Part in a trilogy. This movie here should be compared to Batman Begins. And to answer the question. Yes I think it's better than Batman begins. And if Matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have a better overall trilogy of Batman!

And one more thing which I find very important. Since the movie is rated PG-13 i would still advise parents to have a second thought about taking younger children to the movies. It's a very dark movie and very intense. I personally think it's even a bit hard for some teenagers who might react sensitive to the themes and scenes of the movie.",8/10,1 March 2022,Shazam1303,The Batman (2022),POSITIVE

Most visceral Batman detective Film,"3 Hours run time is totally worth it.

This one feels like a proper Film not a movie.

A well mature dark movie which Batman character deserves.

Robert Pattinson as Batman and Bruce Wayne is the best casting choice after Christian Bale.

It's so dark, gritty, visceral and god damn great.

Colin Farrell as Penguin was Fantastic. Couldn't recognise him.

Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle and Cat woman was great. She was fantastic.

Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, Andy Serkis were great too.

Casting was done greatly.

Batmobile was so f*ing great. When the engine revs, you will get the goosebumps.

Action scenes were absolutely f*ing great. Its loud, bombastic and visceral which will give goosebumps.

Fight sequence were absolutely gritty.

Cinematography done by Greig Fraser is another masterpiece from him.

Michael Giacchino music composition really great. It has that dark gritty grandeur theme music.

The dirty, criminality and madness in Gotham City, you will feel it. It's so dark and grey which Batman character needs.

Production Design is just brilliant.

Story wise this movie felt more to Detective Batman comic book and done outstandingly.

Detective Batman which is the original DC stands for.

I couldn't not find any error in the whole movie.

This is a well made brilliant movie by Matt Reeves.

Totally worth waiting for. Can't wait to see it again.

"Way too long, Pattinson Batman is brooding and sleepy","I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying ""white privileged men"" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious ""woke"" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps. I did like Farrell as the Penguin and the Riddler was basically Dexter the Anti-hero...

Pages come alive,"It was so good! The beginning, the narration, Bruce's voice, his accent, Gotham City, music and sounds... it felt like I'm reading the comic and the pages come alive in my head! It was great! And I live violence, action, crime... this movie has everything! Beautiful car scenes to strong fight scenes to memorable and emotional and dark scenes to those detective scenes... I can't find the right words. You have to watch it.

I was told it's about 3 hours but didn't feel like it. I could easily go on for another hour or more.

And one last thing, make sure to watch it on a big screen because it's very dark and detailed, a movie theatre would be the best place to feel the movie as a whole!

The Emo Batman,"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.

I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.

And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.

I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.

The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.

All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.

Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",6/10,15 April 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,The Batman (2022),NEGATIVE

Reeves' even Darker Knight scores in all the right places.,"THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!

The Batman we've always wanted to see!!,"I got to watch this movie early because of a special screening, I was extremely excited my expectations were very high and still they were surpassed!

Robert as Batman is just awesome, majestic and scary and yet at the end, he also evokes that sense of hope Batman gives to the population.

Paul Dano as The Riddler is so creepy! Both Robert and Paul gave an oscar worthy acting.

The rest of the cast gives amazing performances too!

Beautifully shot and the score is thrilling.

It does feel a bit long but it is rewarding.

Not what I expected...,"I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.

Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.

I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.

The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.

The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.

Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.

I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.

The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.

Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.

The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.

Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies.

"Too long, too muddled","Let's start with the good points - this film doesn't try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.

It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.

Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn't a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.

But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor's people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.

And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.

I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don't get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them.

"A very bold but fairly underwhelming, slow, and bloated Marvel project.","I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.

Now does Wakanda Forever handle the death of T'Challa/Boseman well? Absolutely! Being able to respect the legacy of the actor while also metatextually connecting the event to an in-universe tragedy is definitely one of the movie's standout features. Regardless, I feel like the movie is a little too reliant on the audience being impacted by Boseman's passing.

Don't get me wrong, the fully silent opening gave me chills. They incorporated the death beautifully and honorably, but the result is what feels like two movies in one. You can clearly tell the original script was written before Chadwick's death. I really respect Coogler's decision to not recast, but I still wish T'Challa and Namor got to cross paths.

My issues spring not from the T'Challa-related parts of the film, but from how the rest feels lacking without his presence. I don't think Shuri works as the protagonist. She was a fun (yet underdeveloped) carefree tech nerd in the original movie and here she takes a 180 to being reserved and bitter. The changes to her character were perhaps necessary for this story, but it doesn't make them good changes for her. Some don't match her at all and her vengeful arc is just T'Challa's from Civil War with a less fitting character. She never struck me as someone who would willingly become the Black Panther and there isn't much impact when she does anyway.

Ramonda is a pleasant surprise in this movie. Her monologues are insane. Angela Bassett deserves all the credit she's been receiving. However, Okoye is the only character I felt really connected to and she is stupidly sidelined a third into the movie. She would've enhanced the film a lot if given more screen time. So would've M'Baku, who is completely wasted. Between them and W'Kabi, who is fully absent, we have three characters connected to T'Challa and it isn't explored how his death affected any of them personally. This is one of many missed opportunities that came with trying to focus the movie on both Talokan and T'Challa's death.

Some of the action scenes are awesome and some drag. As to be expected from Danai Gurira, Okoye's fight scenes are the tensest we've gotten from Marvel all year.

Namor himself is a pretty good villain. In a similar fashion to Killmonger, his actor sells the character for me despite his viewpoints being completely ridiculous. They somehow managed to adapt his crazy mutant powers to live-action in a cool way. Changing his kingdom from Atlantis to Talokan ended up being a really cool idea, even though the place and its people needed more elaboration. There are many more cool concepts they could've explored with the Aztec roots. Hopefully they are saving more about the civilization, the people's powers, and their technology for a Namor project.

Ironheart is an even more underdeveloped part of the movie, undoubtedly to save content for her upcoming show. Her character is just as dumb and not relatable as I expected her to be and her suit looks awful. A Black Panther movie didn't feel like the right place to introduce an Iron Man ripoff.

Also, Ross's entire storyline felt weird and unneeded. It's only included to add awkward colonizer jokes and set up future MCU films. If he and Ironheart were removed, there would definitely be enough room to have included more from the aforementioned underutilized characters.

By the latter half of this movie, the pacing really starts to drag. I've complained recently about Marvel movies like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder being way too short, but this film had no reason to be 2 hours and 40 minutes and feel like it's over 3 hours. There's so much downtime between the action that when the final battle starts, the movie has already overstayed its welcome.

The things I'm disappointed they didn't include or flesh out have no excuse to not be here or be better implemented considering how aggressively long and slow the film is.

So this definitely isn't a bad movie per se, but it's not fantastic either. It's very bold but very flawed with iffy decisions on what to prioritize and how to structure this challenging project. I was pretty disappointed when I first saw it, but there's some great stuff sprinkled throughout. The lack of T'Challa, awkward pacing, and wasted opportunities easily made it worse than the first movie to me.

Wakanda: It felt like forever!,"Sorry, but this was boring. Mind-numbing boring. Sleep-inducing boring. ""Are we there,yet?""-boring.

Dang, I liked Mr. Bozeman and they pay some propper respect to his character in the first couple of minutes and it really hits you in the feels but after that we are let known that Wakanda have mastered the technology of exposition dialogue. If that is their main achievement then I say we forget vibranium and let them slink back behind their stealth shield and call it a day.

They could have done so much with this movie and show Africa as a vibrant place full of ideas and hope in the face of many problems. Maybe explore Ubuntu philosophy, or visual art. Unfortunately, Wakandan culture is reduced to a song&dance number for the day-trip tourists in cinema seats.

Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase,"As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.

There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.

Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie. Overall, I felt the end of the MCU Phase 4 was average-which aligns with the MCU Phase 4 as a whole. Here's to hoping the next Phase actually goes somewhere.

Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase, I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 3.0 stars out of 5.",6/10,2 January 2023,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
"Overall, weak","This film had some great stuff in it, there's no doubt of that, but I felt it was overall weak. I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.

Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.

I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.

The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.

The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.

The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline. They could have made it so much better.

Anyway, it was enjoyable and I'll maybe watch it again. But I won't rush to do that.",6/10,19 November 2022,Chanandler-Bong,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!,"I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.

I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.

Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.

I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.

I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.

This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.

A Boring Waste Of Time As Its A Lousy Storyline That Had No Depth To It Whatsoever!,"The only reason this is scoring a five from me is because of the good CGI, magnificent costumes and wonderful scene shots. Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.

They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.

"Extremely Emotional Movie About Loss, Legacy And Healing!","""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""

Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...

The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.

Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.

"Underwhelming, But OK","I just got out of Black Panther

I found it pretty underwhelming. It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.

The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.

Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the end

There is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.

I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.

Disappointment in every aspects,"Most boring Marvel movie yet

We understand that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever won't be the same as what it used to carry but still thinking of some flashy action scenes or a few mesmerizing displays of characters which the movie failed to do so.

__ The movie felt like more or less a family drama with no strong plot for why the agony started in the first place. So if you want to see people just being emotional while wearing costumes, this movie is just for you.

_ Also if you are expecting some interesting turns of events that will disappoint you also. The movie goes in the usual MCU ways and does not significantly represent the way a Black Panther movie should be.

__ So if you have seen the trailer, you already have seen the whole movie and would find nothing new.

A depressing end to a disappointing Phase 4.",2/10,1 February 2023,alexpeychev,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
I liked it a lot,"Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.

If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.

I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.

It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward.",8/10,11 November 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Chadwick Boseman is sorely missed.,"If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?

There is a single mid-credits scene that reveals that the legacy of T'Challa is more than what it first appeared, something I thought the movie was leading toward all along. It opens up a host of possibilities for future BLACK PANTHER films, but I was further disappointed that there is no hint as to where Phase IV of the MCU is heading. That was one of my complaints with THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER and I think the loyal fans are getting restless. Namor is a character with a lot of history with The Fantastic Four, and this would have been an opportunity to give us some idea of how and when they might be introduced into the main MCU. Namor also mentions that he is a mutant, one of the first ones ever in the Marvel universe, raising the possibility of the X-Men showing up-how great would it have been if he'd been approached by Magneto in another after credits scene seeing how their back stories have similarities. Will just have to wait and see what the next Ant-Man movie shows us.

Not Interesting,"No need to beat a dead horse, so ill summarize it as bad plot and generic copycat characters.

This movie really pushed my boredom to the limits. They spend too much time on ceremonies and fantasy lore and almost no time developing the plot. The spent an inordinate amount of time on character development but I still felt nothing for any of them.

This reminded me a lot of the new Dune where the acting seemed ok, and certainly, the movie looked great, but I couldnt care for any of the characters in any way. I felt similarly about Namor and his mermaid people who seemed more like empty plot points than real adversaries.

Frustrating.,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has ambitious goals but does not manage to meet them due to its overlong and sometimes unfocused screenplay that often feels very first draft level in craft and trying to have one too many political conversations to streamline linearly. It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least.",No rating,5 December 2022,Darwinskid,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
I Yield,"First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman's absence, I don't think not all of the movie's downfalls are linked to his absence.

Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she's the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart's introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she's a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn't clear why they were fighting. It still isn't clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda's death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart's value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother's death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn't know what happened.

There were positive things too. I thought Taloka's story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that's a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.

I'd also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it's a tough transition. She's been known as the geek scientist sister but now she's the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That's a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.

In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception.

I fell asleep multiple times,"This movie had so many slow parts. I kept falling asleep. This is very unusual for me. Unfortunately, it just could not keep my attention. It was nowhere near as good as the first Black Panther movie. I appreciate that they were trying to be respectful toward Chadwick Boseman, but I think they overdid it. Also, Martin Freeman's role in this movie was... odd. It felt shoehorned in as a touchstone to the previous Black Panther movie. Finally, I'm not sure how they are going to redeem Namor. He came off as a true villain and wasn't redeemed at all. Is the plan to have him continue to be a villain going forward?

Pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to 2018's ""Black Panther"" and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.

One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.

After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.

Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.

I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.

Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.

This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.

Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.

Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.

Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.

I rate it 8/10.",8/10,10 November 2022,MrDHWong,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Namor was great - should have been his movie,"Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.

The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.

Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.

Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters.

A great send off and a great beginning,"Disney/Marvel please give us more of this! It was a return to form and better! The characters were real and grounded. There was actual emotion from the actors/actresses/characters and throughout the movie as a whole. A laugh here or there, PERFECTLY BALANCED (as all things should be). As someone who recently lost a loved one, the movie hit me in the feels hard, something I've come to not expect from a Disney/Marvel production. I mean seriously loved this movie. I also find it admirable how respectful the production was towards Mr. Boseman. I'm also glad they did not over play Ironman through Riri Williams. Of course there's always something to nitpick but they were completely overshadowed in my opinion. Someone please give Ms. Bassett a damn crown, she was a jewel in this film! I will 100% see this again!

*A Disappointing Sequel*,"*Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* is a somber and underwhelming follow-up to the groundbreaking original. While it attempts to honor the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, the film struggles to find its own identity.

The introduction of Namor and the underwater kingdom of Talokan is a missed opportunity. The character lacks the depth and complexity of the original film's villains. His motivations are inconsistent, and his actions often defy logic. The conflict between Wakanda and Talokan feels forced and lacks the emotional resonance of the first film.

The film's focus on grief and loss, while understandable, is overly drawn out. The constant reminders of T'Challa's absence become repetitive and hinder the narrative's progression. Shuri's transformation into the new Black Panther feels rushed and unearned, lacking the character development necessary to support such a significant role.

The film's exploration of Wakanda's vulnerability is a promising concept, but it is ultimately undermined by a predictable plot and underdeveloped characters. The third act descends into a generic superhero battle, devoid of the cultural richness and thematic depth of the first film.

*Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. While it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman, it ultimately falls short of honoring his legacy.",6/10,26 July 2024,chiragrathod19,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
Was this a joke?,"I enjoyed the Black Panther even though it was not all that great in the first place. This sequel was a hot mess. Wakanda is no longer even a semblance of a secret African country, just a location where black people are playing dress up in a movie. A lot of the storylines just fell flat. Some characters just appeared for 2 minutes and never heard of again.

At times there was so much dialogue which did nothing to further the plot, where was the editing team? There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.

The CGI was good and the action was pretty good. Its a Marvel superhero movie so I didn't expect much more than this. Black Panther was always a favorite comic book hero of mine and I am saddened that they could not do better for that legacy.

"A Fantastic, Emotional, and Mature Marvel Film","Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.

Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.

Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.

With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.",9/10,11 November 2022,kjproulx,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Overblown and Oversaturated Airplane Movie,"At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.

I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.

To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.

Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.

It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie.

Nearly A Walk Out of the Theater Bad Sequel!,"Wakanda Forever had many gaps & was centered around the rituals for too long rather than using that time to better support the storyline itself. The 1st movie though had a good balance and the story was great! The decent acting performances in Wakanda Forever (in particular Namor, Ramonda, M'Baku and Okoye) were wasted by an incredibly poor script for the Riri character! I felt like the primary focus of the movie became lost as the movie progressed after a very slow and boring start which could have been forgiven if the storyline didn't continue to worsen. The 1st Black Panther movie was amazing, but Wakanda Forever was an utter disappointment! I'd regret watching this movie if it was completely free! I have never seen such a horrible Marvel film in my lifetime! The action scenes saved me from walking out of the theater! I'm judging this movie for what it is & not the unfortunate tragedy of the main character's before the sequel was filmed.

Way to long and boring? Yes.,"I was let down with this one. Action was sub par. Tried to hard to be ""emotionally relevant"". I understand the tribute to Chadwick, but this whole movie was kind of a downer. Way too goodie two shoes. This was almost... almost, as bad as Wonder Woman 2. I don't understand why they had to drag this out for almost three hours. The underwater city was completely non visible because it was so dark. It was also like they were a primitive people. Playing with rocks? No machines? And really can't live out of water. One well placed nuke and the whole civilization is gone. Obviously not a lot of thought went into this one but at least we got some more female lead characters out of it.

Messy,"The way they went with the movie is interesting really but the execution didn't live up to the hype that was advertised. In this movie you can tell in many scenes that it was supposed to be tchalla not Shuri. There should have been a significant amount of rewrites or a completely new script. The design choices in this movie is not that good really as Namor wasn't looking great and the same with iron heart. There are too many plot holes in this one and many open stories that would mention the 1st movie was abruptly closed and that overall experience was bland and boring to a fan and to the general audience this movie is something u only need to see once to understand the bigger picture.

Beautiful and emotional,"An emotional journey, beautifully done. The exceptional cast, moved me to tears multiple times. Twice from sadness once from joy (no spoilers! Haha) The sold out theatre on opening night not only applauded but many had tears they were trying to wipe away.

It is a 3 hour movie but it didn't feel that way to me, I was engaged every step of the way and eager to see the journey.

Black panther movies continue to excel in the marvel universe. The way they showcase two cultures that are entirely from the comics, using cultural clothing, languages, building sets and gorgeous visuals really make you feel they are real. The strong female characters in this movie are bada$s and show the struggle to be a force for good in this world (a world that doesn't make that easy!).

"It's fine, I guess?","First off, it's long. There's minimal action. The action there is is disappointing. So we have a fairly boring movie. I get the intention to focus on the emotional notes in the wake of CB's death, but it just didn't hit me in my feels. My husband cried. A lot. I remain unmoved. The visuals appear very muted when compared to first movie. Bizarre inclusion of naming conventions/explanations à la Solo movie. We get even more characters getting nano suits. Really? I know it's hard to come up with new ideas, but we've seen more than enough of these at this point.

As I said, it's fine. I guess. Definitely didn't hate it.

"Tender, human, tragic and Beautiful","The biggest compliment I can give this film is just how human it feels, you can feel the grief and sadness pouring through every shot. But perhaps the best part of this movie is the grief isn't used to make it good the story is compelling, Namor is a great villain and Shuris arc in the course of this movie was amazing and some of marvels best character arc. Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan (sorry if misspelled) was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy. But aside from that this has to be one of the better marvel movies and worthy successor to the original black panther.

Not Much to Like About This One,"After waiting just over a week from release to watch this, I hadn't seen or read any previews or spoilers and I really have to say that I was disappointed in the film.

The underwater scenes were terrible, the action was subpar, sometimes confusing and the humor was simply sad. The movie drug on feeling every bit of its 2.5hrs length, not always, but sometimes felt like a political statement.

I liked the first Black Panther movie and miss seeing Chadwick reprise his role like everyone else, but we really need two separate instances of paying homage to him in the film?

The only bright spots of the film for me was seeing Shuri assume the mantle of the panther and M'baku take a step forward on the character development front.

My advice would be to wait for this one to come out on Disney+.

"2 long, 2 boring, bad CGI and bad ""action""","1. Movie should have been at least 45 minutes shorter 2. Acting was terrible with a few exceptions- Winston Duke and Angela Bassett both did great. Letitia Wright, Dominique Thorne and the rest were all over the place. Too emotional or barely any acting.

3. Iron Heart was incredibly lame as a character and as a part of the story. Apprently Tony Stark was not a genius considering every charactor in the MCU is able to create the same things he did. Half the characters in this movie have their won armor, super labs and / or figured out Vibraniun, AI and super soldier level serums.

4. As everyone else mentioned, the inclusion of the Ross and Valentina characters was a huge mistake and dragged an already long and boring film even more.

5. Namor was terrible. Actor was ok, this version of the character had no personality, no charm, no charisma and none of the a-hole traits that make up Namor all together. Awful, awful version of this character. Also, said to be as strong as the Hulk, but has to dodge bullets, can't fly through enemy fighter crafts? Has to consistently grab the thing and try to throw it? Gets beaten by a Black Panther that has like 5 minutes of fighting experience? CHUMP!

6. The CGI is, once again, terrible. Aquatic animals look awful, characters jumping on and off them look like a video game glitch, Planes (jets? Whatever the aircraft fighters are called) lack dimension and basically looked like a pre-render version someone forgot to complete.

7. Wakanda is land locked. Except, it isn't and this is never explained.

8. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation on Earth but they get destroyed by a bunch of fish people using stone age weapons and no technology.

9. This movie brings lazy, non-consistent writing and story telling to a whole new lever for MCU. One of the worst movies of the year.

I am sold on this by the incredible human story, presented to us by a truly amazing cast. The chemistry between Suri and Namor is totally convincing, and very well acted. It is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman while still progressing the plot and moving on from Endgame. Whether or not we return to Wakanda rests entirely with Marvel. As someone who has followed the comics and the films for more than 50 years, I can say that this film and its predecessor embody all that is good in the MCU.

"Maybe a bit too long than it needed to be, but it was decent","I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of the mixed reviews, but it was actually decent. The plot was probably a Marvel formula plot, but I found it intriguing because it was interesting to see how Wakanda would cope after the death of the Black Panther. I liked the new characters especially the underwater species who made me doubt whether the Wakandans would beat them. I thought the action scenes were good especially the last fight scene which was pretty epic. I hope this is the last Black Panther movie because I think another movie would not turn out good and Marvel seem like they've run out of ideas.

"Yawn, zzzz","Depsite there being a few interesting aspects to this film, like a number of elements that seemed to have been borrowed from Ancient Greek mythology (namely the sirens and the winged feet), I have to admit that I found that this film was rather dull and boring. I guess one of the reasons was that Boseman's death seemed to be hanging over the entire film. Sure, one should pay tribute to him, but the problem is that I felt that it went just a little bit too far at times, and thus it really wasn't all that enjoyable.

The film is basically about how the rest of the world have become rather annoyed at Wakunda because they aren't willing to share Vibranium with them, but they then discover some at the bottom of the ocean, using a machine that has been designed to detect vibranium. However, the rig is attacked and everybody on the rig is killed, and of course the people who are first accused is Wakunda. It turns out that they aren't the only ones who have access to vibranium, as the leader of a nation of undersea peoples approaches them and instructs them to find the scientist who invented the detector.

Okay, ignoring the fact that a country who's economy is based on a single resource (and a resource that they don't even trade) is unlikely to become a world superpower (and of course they clearly don't want to interact with the rest of the world either), it does put things into perspective, particularly with regards to the United States. Unlike the previous film, there is more going on in the United States, and there is clearly some animosity towards Wakanda, namely because they aren't willing to play fair, at least play fair as far as the developed world is concerned.

However, the main focus of the film seems to involve two empires who have vibranium coming into contact with each other, and the question iswho would win in the battle. This, mind you, results in there being a number of other plots that seem to not get resolved, or get resolved a bit too quickly, particularly the one involving the CIA agent who is eventually arrested because, well, he has got a bit too close to the Wakundans. Of course, we also have the ending, which is interesting, namely due to the suggestion that Wakunda may not actually be able to effectively integrate into the world at large.

Still, in the end, I really found that this film was quite lacking, and rather boring. Some have suggested that Marvel can't do sequels, but I don't think that is the case because they have released some pretty good sequels. However, as for this one, I can't really place my finger on it, but it really didn't grab me all that much, and in part I really couldn't wait for it to end.

Well... it's not what I expected,"Saw this the other night at the movies. The cinema was packed with joyous Marvel fans who have obviously enjoyed the first Black Panther movie. The first 30 minutes into the movie, the audience vibes cooled off noticeably. After 2h41, most people stood up and quickly left the theater, more than half of the crowd not even caring for the end credit scene. Well, that tells you something...

After the screening, our group of four discussed what disappointed the most: was it the dragging narrative (trying to tell too many stories and trying to pleasing too many audiences), the lengthy dialogues (which to me felt like they made up 2/3 of this movie), the rushed/forced action scenes or (what bothered me the most) the absence of the Black Panther for most of the running time. In the end, the movie disappoints on many levels.

Just disappointing.,"While there were parts that were entertaining as a whole this movie was just boring. They could have easily cut 40 minutes of the movie, there were many long pauses and seemed badly edited in parts.

Tenoch Huerta as Namor was good. I like the actor and thought the changing of the character's story was decent knowing they're probably going to use his story to explain future characters entering the MCU.

Choosing to make this movie more of an ensemble I felt wasn't the best choice as there are some characters that are not that interesting. Martin Freeman's character Everett Ross could have easily been cut from the film.

Letitia Wright as Shuri was good but we have never seen her character train or fight outside of shootings blasters in the first Black Panther and Infinity War/End Game. It was kinda BS she could go toe to toe with Namor who is thousands of years old and clearly has more training than her.

It made Shuri come off as a Mary Sue character which is sad as the character from the comics had a lot of training. All the wasted time on long takes and characters staring off into the background could have been used to develop her taking on the mantle. Instead she just puts the suit on and that's it...

Not as good as the last one,"Watched Black Panther Wakanda Forever Without doubt Spider-Man is my favourite superhero in Marvel, but in the MCU films Black Panther was the the best, a brilliant film, I was very sad when Chadwick Boseman died that we would not see him in any more films, and it's MCU tradition it seems not to recast a role (big respect for that) well except Howard Stark that I know of

I though the film did great respect to Boseman, no doubt they had to totally rethink the plot after the tragedy but they did it well and respected his memory.

The opening credits were especially good for this, no sound in respect for the scene before it, and featuring only clips of Boseman as they had done in Captain Marvel when Stan Lee died.

I do not think however it's better than the first Black Panther film, it's like they were doing too much, making it seem not like a continuation of Black Panther and Wakanda, but a 'stepping off' film for the new hero's the film introduced - Midnight Angels and Iron Heart.

Of course they have done this before, Captain America Civil War was the 'stepping off' film for Spider-Man and Black Panther himself, but thier roles blended into the story and did not overtake it as happened here.

"Emotional, Mature Film With A Lot To Say","This film was special. We knew it was going to be emotional, but it ended up having a lot more to say than I anticipated. Themes of loss, grief, legacy, are also intertwined with a story our world's history of invasion and war over the balance of power and resources. It was definitely a long film for a reason but there was a purpose to every scene. Overall this ended up being one of (if not the) heaviest and most emotional films of the MCU.

Starting with the cinematography - this film was absolutely beautiful. Wakanda is as vibrant as ever and Talokan was an awesome addition as a setting. The costume design, environments, colors, character designs of the Talokan's were just stunning and some of the battle sequences were amazing to look at.

The plot was very good. Expectedly, I was crying 60 seconds into the film. A tragedy sends all of our characters into mourning but the relentless looming threats forces them to hold their heads up and choose their future. Shuri is ironically and poetically thrust into a very similar heroes journey focused on revenge that her brother originally walked during Civil War. In the meantime, Namor and his people are portrayed as a sympathetic people - victims of prior invasion. The common ground they share with Wakanda is very intentional and very interesting as a plot point. Even with different cultures and ideologies, the similarities between human beings are ever present and we are all vulnerable to conflict, hatred, and greed.

The performances were incredibly strong - likely because the actors were in a sense living a similar story, which is awful, but it shows and they make you feel it. Angela Bassett is just stunning and powerful as Queen Mother. Leticia Wright just makes you feel every second of her grief. And Danai Gurira absolutely shines here - I've never felt so much for Okoye. Dominique Thorne was awesome as Riri and I'm very excited to see more of Ironheart.

All in all, this was a special and beautiful film. It does get a bit long and serious in the middle for a superhero movie so people may find that hard to sit with, especially upon rewatch. But I think Ryan Coogler used that time to tell an important, heart wrenching story filled with grief but also hope and shined a light of respect and legacy upon the crew's late friend, Chadwick Boseman.",8/10,11 November 2022,JayDeeezy,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Perfect tribute to Chadwick Boseman !,"This movie is emotional in terms of its storyline and we know why.

I love this movie.

The themes in this movie of grief, revenge, legacy, and family were astounding and handled very well. It has dark theme which I liked the most.

The cinematography was incredible along with the costume design and soundtrack. The CGI was really well done.

I definitely recommend seeing this in theatres if you can, I know that I'm going to be making more trips back to see it a few more times. All I have to say now is - Rest in Peace Chadwick Boseman... your legacy will always be with us.

"Unlikely to make the same impact as the original, Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing","A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.

The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.

Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.

With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.

As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.

Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.

Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig Göransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.

With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sight

Final Say -

Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment.

3 1/2 wing feet out of 5.

Talocan forever!,"Enough has been said by other reviewers about the film's overall weaknesses - it's overlong, meandering and drags in many places. Instead, I want to focus on a question no one else seems to be asking: what is up with these Wakandans?

I was a definite fan of the first movie, but as the sequel progressed, I found myself more and more annoyed (and irritated) by the film's semi-religious Wakandaphilia. Frankly, the constant self-adulation and smug sense of exceptionalism displayed by every Wakandan character really started to grate. After a while, what I'm sure the film-makers see as a message of empowerment starts to sound a lot like fascistic aggrandizement. If this degree of messianic self-love were displayed by characters in any other (real) country, it would be dismissed as overblown nationalism.

Let's not forget, as the film itself points out, Wakanda is a superpower - possibly the most powerful nation on earth, thanks to its stocks of 'vibranium' - so it's difficult to swallow the idea that they are also somehow persecuted victims. Add to this the fact that they jealously try to preserve their monopoly of this most valuable resource, and its associated technology, and its hard not to see Wakanda as just another arrogant and self-interested power.

Indeed, after a while, my sympathies shifted much more to the rival Talocans, who with some justification came to see Wakanda as more of a threat than an ally. Maybe the next movie could be called Talocan Forever, and show their side of the story instead.",5/10,12 November 2022,RogerRoger77,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
A Fitting Tribute,"At the risk of overstatement, it's hard not to be blown away by writer-director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed.",9/10,12 November 2022,brentsbulletinboard,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
"I wanted to LOVE this film, I think my expectations were too high.","Beautiful tribute to Chadwick in the opening scenes, great moment of silence as well. The acting was good, the script wasn't bad, POC and women represented well too. I can't put my finger on exactly what was lacking. Maybe the pace, the length of the movie or the special effects I'm not sure. It just wasn't good. However It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. When I left the theater after the first one there was applause and everyone doing the ""Wakanda Forever"" move. This one was silent and almost a head scratcher. Like it feels bad to dislike this film. But I was disappointed. This new Marvel Phase is horrible.

"Disappointment, what more can I say","Based on other's reviews, I had such high hopes...

The plot is bad, like really bad... nothing makes sense, and resources are wasted left and right, with absolutely no advancement what so ever...

Ships are used when it's convenient, and normal whales are indestructible transports used by underwater supermen...

The starting point of this Movie: involves the use of a device to find vibranium; which is successful, it's then revealed there are only two locations where this magical metal exists, and the underwater people spend the rest of movie... searching for the ""scientist"" who made the device(even though the location has already been discovered).

It then turns out the ""scientist"" is just a college girl, with cringe after cringe recall to cheap imitations of past Marvel themes... At one point, the police literally exclaim, ""she's got an Ironman suit""; which she then uses, to kill a ton of police, and no one seems to care; or thinks to use a ship to just escape.

The water people(who's legend just barely makes sense), live so deep in the Ocean; it's near impossible to get there, and all their people have in human amounts of strength...

The main villain is so powerful: he's basically indestructible, with no weaknesses; except getting too dry... which still isn't a deal breaker, and only slightly limits what he can do.

I'm not sure where these 5 and higher reviews are coming from... My only guess is... they gave a review without having actually watched this movie...

In the end: it's just lazy writing, given to badly developed characters, that exist in the Marvel universe... If that doesn't sound so bad... give it try... but be warned; you may fall asleep while watching...

A very mediocre movie,"Really? Is this one of the most appreciated Marvel movies of the last two years? Just let me explain. This movie is not bad, it's just...average. The plot is really simple, just the classic hero that tries to save his (or her?) kingdom from a threatening new menace, who is Namor (that i must admit, he's one of the most characterized villains of all time in the MCU). The problem of this movie is the length, two and a half hours to explain a story that it would have taken just 2 hours maximum is too much. Then again, the tribute to Chadwick Boseman was really beautiful, but you can't just judge an entire film based on the commemoration of that actor. This movie is just really boring, too slow, and the third and final act is mediocre to say the least, with the final fight of the new Black Panther and Namor that lasts something like...30 seconds? (and i am really generous). It's another mediocre film of the phase 4, Ryan Coogler just had no ideas how to write this new film and decided to base the entire narration about loss and family themes but, unfortunately, it didn't work really well for him.

"Good tribute, bad movie","I was personally a big fan of the first black panther movie. Everything from the style, the story and the mixture of a future like city blended with African culture was for me a great watching experience.

Wakanda forever however, had some great scenes creating the same vibe with the mixture between African and future like cities. The story, the other shown new city, the new character, the plot. All of these are not on the level that I expected from this movie. It was decent, okay even. But this movie did not get me as excited as the first black panther, or the latest dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness.

Commendable,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a very nice effort. Letitia Wright's performance as Shiru was admirable.

The story of the movie was decent. The movie is very well directed. The songs were sounding perfect in the background. The costumes of the characters were beautiful. The cinematography was also adequate. All the emotional scenes were well executed. At some places, the story was falling apart, but the brilliant performances saved that. The fighting scenes were satisfactory.

In a nutshell, it was enjoyable and it could have been extra-ordinary, but it was a good and memorable tribute to Chadwick Boseman.

A Rollercoaster,"Wakanda Forever is a complete rollercoaster. Starting with emotional scenes, and finishing the film with high packed action. Talking about the positives, the production design, music, and color grading is amazing. The visual effects take you deeper into the film and culture. The actors have done an amazing job and Ryan Coogler is the backbone of the film. Coming to the negatives, the duration could've been shorter, the climax was placed a bit early. A few scenes had noticeably mid CGI. The film failed to emotionally connect with the audience during the climax scenes. Rest assured, it's a lovely film and a must watch one. The comic fans and Namor fans would be completely satisfied.

Obvious Avatar rip-off.,"Wakanda Forever rips off Avatar concepts and ideas shamelessly. I'll make a list: 1. Plot revolves around precious mineral. Avatar - unobtanium; Black Panther - vibranium.

2. Race of blue colored beings.

3. Humans want to exploit precious mineral which is found in large quantities right under where blue colored beings live. Exploiting said mineral will inevitably result in the destruction of blue guy race.

4. Said blue colored beings can control the minds of large animals.

5. Blue colored beings use these animals as means of transportation.

6. Blue colored beings are indigenous and spiritual.

7. Blue colored beings are anti-technology.

Disappointing,"I will write my first ever review on IMDB. This is a no spoiler review.

Bad Things: The movie is 2 hours 40 minutes long. My expectations from Marvel movie is that they have to be sharp, about 2 hours mark (except for Avengers) and lots of actions. This movie is none of these. The movie is quite long, a lot of talking and is on very less actions. Plot wise few things don't make sense. Clearly missing Chadwick's charm.

Good: CGI look slick. There is some humour and little bit of predictable suspense factor. Movie is high on emotions.

I am a big fan of superheroes movies but this one along with Thor 4 has been disappointed for me. In fact, I have found Black Adam more entertaining than Black Panther 2.

"Chadwick was missed, but they still delivered","The imagery, the portrayal of Black people was masterful!! The costume design was phenomenal. A young, black woman as a STEM prodigy was a fantastic character to inspire young girls. Angela Bassett deserves all of her flowers. She has played a lot of iconic roles and she didn't disappoint as Queen Ramonda. She has buried her husband and son and had to lead a nation that is constantly being preyed upon by Colonizers. Namor as a villain or anti-hero was perfect. You want to hate him, but his motives were pure. He just wanted the same thing Wakandas wanted: to protect his world from Vibranium poachers. Having Shuri have visions of Killmonger was a surprise! Glad to see how she melded his vision with T'Challa's.

My only complaint is that for all they did to protect Bucky, they could've tapped Sebastian Stan to come film for the funeral scene.

Not the Black Panther we were promised,"The movie is fine overall but it's so very long.

The story takes ages to go anywhere but the scenes move way too quickly into the next ones.

Namor was a great villain with a really interesting change and served to be the highlight of the film but it wasn't quite enough to save it and keep me invested.

It did feel at times like a beautiful goodbye to Chadwick Bozeman but it often seemed to forget that it's a movie too.

It also never really answers why the FBI are after Riri Williams (Iron Heart) they just show up and it kind of felt like they just wanted more involvement for Martin Freeman and Julia Louis Dreyfus than any practical, story telling reasons.

What????,"This movie is so bad it's hard to focus my editorial! The first Black Panther movie had many problems and some very horrible scripting but this next movie is so bad that I don't know where to begin. I hope that this movie quietly sails off into the horizon and then falls off the edge of the earth. Don't waste precious time on this tripe! It's a shame Chad Bozeman passed away so young he was perhaps the only socially redeeming quality of the first movie. The clearly racist anti male anti family over tones are just disgusting. Is this the best we can hope for now from the Marvel universe, really? Run away from this one you will regret the lost time.

"""It looks like there's a tree blocking the road""...","...said the driver of a prison transport van when he stopped in front of a tree blocking the road. Dude, when you have to stop, there IS a tree blocking the road. Obviously it helps to get out of the car to walk a couple of meters next to the tree to see that it actually is one the road... Logic got left behind. To me, small details matter a lot and this movies is full of things like the afore mentioned situation. A new interesting and very powerfull race is immediately made into an enemy that just wants to wipe everyone of the map for the stupidest reason ever. No one mentions or tries to do any research into who they actually are or even asks them when their leader is first encountered either. Negotiations are not even mentioned and almost evrything is decided in the blink of an eye, on both sides. I do not remember the Wakandans being so full of themselves and the enemy isn't any better. These huge, advanced and old societies that have existed in peace for ages, they sure are quick to go to war...

There's a lot of dialogue that is way overscripted/too complicated and rarely does anyone have regular sounding conversations. It's like everyone is in constant conflict with each other. Surprisingly M'Baku is basically the only major character who shows any restraint and actually stops to think and calmly expresses at least some alternatives (after he has experienced the strenght of the enemy).

The traditions and rituals that gave Wakanda a unique identity in the first movie are mostly discarded (I guess that this is mainly because Suri is a modern techie who doesn't believe/cate about them and only trusts in her tech and she constantly rebels and acts out like a bloody teenager) and what little there is lacks any comparable depth.

The best parts are probably the those that are dedicated to T'Challa and Chadwick Boseman and they have a few quite emltional scenes. Outside of those there's too much going on here, rgere, everywhere, and nothing has any true substance. Some parts are also way too fairytaly.

Sadly, the movie lacks the charisma and talent of Chadwick Boseman. Winston Duke could have filled that hole with his powerful presence but he is utilized even less than before even when he has a major role in the current government. Instead the focus is on our techie girl and I she would have worked much, much better if she had stayed in that role. I have nothing against female hero's but Wakanda Forever feels more like some Disney cartoon aimed for young teenagers and it's way too nice, simple and a even bit childish.

The first one had much more serious tone and it was also a lot better thought out. I'm suprised that this was written and directed by the same people because this felt completely different. This is easily one of the most boring MCU movies to date I'm sad to say.

A Disney movie,"It took them long but they finally made it. Marvel has lost their punch and it's all about watering stories down. Wakanda gets destroyed but nothing really happens. One wave of a hand and everything is suddenly rebuilt, they are all friends again and living happily ever after. The jokes are a repetition of the first movie (like Okoye saying that people with iPhones are primitive). Also there are character arches that do not make sense at all, like Everett Ross or Namor himself (he wants to kill Riri but once she is at hand he doesn't however he has no problem destroying Wakanda and afterwards he bends the knee?). This movie also felt like the cast hated each other, and Suri did not show chemistry with anyone really. The credit scene felt like a way to get rid of her as black panther in the future.

On the other hand there are nice nods to the late Chadwick Boseman and some of the actors (like Angela Basset or Lupita Nyong'o, I also liked Tenoch Huerta) made up in good acting for the gaps in the story.

Maybe I was expecting too much but it has definitely disappointed me.

You can't base your feelings on this movie on the absence of Chadwick Boseman,"I've seen a few lower ratings where the biggest reason for the rating seems to be the absence of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; to rate your feelings on this film based on him not physically being there is just unfair. He and everyone else involved didn't really have much of a choice for him not to be in it. So what was the other options? Never make another Black Panther film? Deep fake him for the rest of his MCU appearances?

This sequel was a great tribute to Chadwick. A great sequel overall. And for me personally, I might prefer it based mostly around the villain(s).

There were a lot of unfair comments based around the actor playing Namor before anyone actually got to see him portray the character. Mostly based around his looks. In my opinion, he did a great job at portraying this character; you could empathise with him and his people, whilst they also came across as very intimidating and pretty spooky at times. Also Namor is actually very easy on the eyes if I do say so myself 😌

Riri Williams didn't irk the way people made her out she would, obviously basing their initial opinions on the comic version of her which is fair. But she came across as pretty grounded and likeable to me.

The soundtrack was fantastic and I have no complaints in terms of VFX. The actors' performances were top notch as to be expected.

So generally, no complaints from me. Marvel chose a great film to end Phase 4 👏🏻",8/10,12 November 2022,ViciousCXY,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
", Wakanda he's definitely missing Chadwick","This movie is very underwhelming. The beginning isn't that bad, but they really need to get something in the middle, because the storyline just kind of fell through. The characters are a little bit weak, and the introduction of the underworld people doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

It doesn't make much sense that no one's ever heard of these people living under the water for the last thousand years.

On a lighter note, so they did a nice tribute to Chadwick in the beginning, which makes the movie somewhat watchable. But there is a giant hole with him not in it. Not sure if this movie needed to be made or not.

I'll give it a six out of respect for Chadwick.

Loved it.,"Was always going to be challenging to deliver a second movie without Chadwick Boseman. However they did a fantastic job at honoring him and continuing to develop the story. The Queen was incredible and really carried the story along. Her poise and strength was fantastic , as were many of the performances. It balanced loss with humour , which is no easy thing to do. Aside from the great acting , the fight scenes and cinematography were excellent. There were even a few scenes which almost had me in tears of both joy and sadness. I am really glad they brought many of the characters back and developed them a bit more. If you liked the first , I would highly recommend this one also. Loved it.

A kingdom (and a movie) lost without its leader,"Chadwick Boseman's death was so sad and sudden, and I still shed a tear when thinking about it, especially as he embodied a character, King T'Challa: The Black Panther, that meant so much to so many. Marvel and director Ryan Coogler made the prudent decision not to recast him in order to honor his memory and legacy. Rest in power, King.

In the immediacy of tragedy, removing T'Challa as a character made sense. Unfortunately, one can't help but feel when watching Wakanda Forever that the lack of his presence brought not just the titular kingdom into turmoil, but the movie itself as well. A mistake by the powers-that-be in the long run. This movie is a rudderless ship that no one in the cast is strong enough to anchor. Disjointed, multiple storylines and characters that seem extraneous and unnecessary (Agent Ross with Director de Fontaine and and Riri/Ironheart in particular) stretch the movie into an unwarranted runtime. The central conflict between Wakanda and Namor's (Tenoch Huerta is far and away the most compelling and charismatic part of the movie, but doesn't get enough screentime--typical of the MCU's antagonists lately) forces is undercooked and lost amidst the mismatched ideas of how to carry the story forward.

Ultimately, it befalls Shuri to assume the mantle of Black Panther, but frankly Letitia Wright is not a enough performer to do so, and her arc is rather odd and disingenuous leading to the moment that trailers spoiled months ago.

Very weak and mediocre movie,"We have reached a point at which people will watch anything that has the tag ""Marvel"" on it. I kept fighting to prevent myself from falling asleep during the first hour. It's incredibly slow and nothing interesting happens. Namor and Talokans could be terrifying but couldn't reach their full potential.

The forced jokes weren't funny at all. The action sequences doesn't look good. The background tracks/scores were too much or had no control. It stood seperate from what's happening.

I can understand why they should be grieving but grief isn't so good for a marvel movie. They didn't handle it well either. The wow factor is missing and the whole movie falls flat.

Black Panther Lives On,"I'm appalled by the emotion in this movie. The action is breath taking, and the story line is impeccable!! I couldn't stop glaring with a sense of hope and pride with my fists balled tight in many scenes in this movie! Ryan Has done again. What an amazing film director with an amazing team. I didn't think it would be as good as the first one but was I wrong. The acting in this movie moved me. Definitely the best move I've watched this year by far!!! I want to watch again already. I pride myself off being strict when it come to rating movies. Black Panther 2 did it for me. Peace love and blessings! Nothing less than 10/10 🖤

Should Have Been a Series,"There is a huge amount story to tell in this very large scope world of Wakanda. Lots of characters with lots of goals to obtain. All the major characters are quite emotionally driven I must say. With so much to accomplish, the audience has a lot to digest in one long sitting. This type of ensemble setting with kingdoms and leaders and betrayals works better as a ""Game of Thrones"" type of series. It would also give the audience more time to appreciate the production design and costumes. The appealing look of the film helped to give the character performances more impact. The story rightly avoids being about the missing main character, the now deceased Black Panther. His absence draws the movie's attention to the supporting characters, and they are given a lot to do.

The large story justifies the long running time, sure. But the storylines could have been given more attention to the audiences' benefit. So good filmmaking all around. Angela Bassett commands the screen in Chad Boseman's place with great success. As usual there are big action scenes with lots of CGI. They are perfunctory as usual.",6/10,20 November 2022,kgprophet,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
"Misery, misery, misery, that's what you've chosen.","The modern opinion of the MCU is that it is quickly fading and that the superhero bubble as a whole is soon going to burst. This film is more fuel to that fire. The Ironheart suit is awful. Looks terrible & out of place among everything else it shares a scene with. Everything about this film is miserable and horrible. A big aspect of the marketing was the mystery of who the new Black panther will be. Although it was obviously Suri as no one else is even close to being that thin. Why should the audience care about a character wearing an indestructible cat suit? There are no stakes to it. Namor is good. Everything else is boring, nonsensical and drawn out to a tedious 3 hours.

Bad editing ruined it; the stellar score and wardrobe couldn't save it,"This film and its prequel both had exceptional visual design, particularly in the diverse wardrobe styles displayed, and throught-provoking instrumentation in the score. The score was particularly captivating this time around. But none of this could save the film from its pacing, clarity and consistency issues.

Even if we forget the outright errors (where the audio didn't match the visuals), the film just had a lot of awkward silence, like the actors were expecting quick cuts and were just waiting for direction. There were hundreds of places I would have cut a second here, two seconds there, enough not only to bring some energy into the pacing, but also to buy more time to understand Namor's people. Little time is spent really getting to empathize with them. Even Namor's story lacked clarity and fleshing out.

More than 90 minutes in, the story finally started to get interesting, with noteworthily well-done action sequences. But even then, it was painfully obvious that some sequences where done by entirely different teams, with completely inconsistent tonality. So it was hard to enjoy the good parts, with how different they were from the rest.

I admit I had high hopes for the final film of Phase 4, but this just didn't deliver.",No rating,11 November 2022,SureCommaNot,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
Not for me,"I felt like it was boring for the most part just too many slow scenes and unnecessary scenes that could've been cut. And I honestly didn't really care for the villain plot it felt like Kilmongers same logic being used again for the villains main goals & intentions. The action scenes were good but it wasn't much of that until an hour or so into the story. Which makes the story pacing seem to last forever. Also the villains perspective? Couldnt even relate to it his reaction to the outside world seemed rather late as he waited so long to even make a attempt to wage war and get revenge which just doesn't make sense when you see how powerful he was at such an young age. And there was an absurdly large amount of female characters in the movie it was hardly any male representation in the story. I don't mind female characters especially Okoye and Nakia I love both. But without the male character M'Baku it feels like you go majority of the movie with just female characters and that sucks. I truly missed Chadwick and his presence in the movie. Black Panther just won't be the same without him. Overall not one of the better Marvel movies.

"For Honor, For Legacy, For Wakanda!","The first black panther was mostly focused on Wakandan affairs, this one really expands that but despite the wider scope it is one of the most intimate movies in the MCU so far. Less action and more about honoring Black Panther's death, if felt more real considering Chadwick himself passed; it was also more political handling the passing of power and as I did my best to avoid spoilers and teaser trailers, I've found out the big secret was already revealed in a leak. I'll try avoiding the spoilers.

As said earlier, this one doesn't not only like focus on wakanda, it widens it's scope to the whole world. It increases the stakes, making it seem like an elaborate plot scheme. I loved that it was evenly matched throughout, Wakanda seemed to have better tech but Talocans seemed to be stronger fighters.

Namor had a really cool, mysterious intro. M'baku was hilarious, the movie was generally quite comedic for the first half but unlike other recent marvel movies it fortunately wasn't forced humor. Action felt seldom especially considering the runtime, but after watching the first black panther just before they were better. It's slow paced so this isn't as blood rushing as other marvel movies, don't expect constant tension or fights. Everyone was as good as you'd expect but Angela Bassett gave an amazing performance and stood out. As was the first movie, I still feel like Andy Serkis is an underrated perfect casting.

Opening scene honors T'challa and opening credits for Chadwick, it's continued throughout. It had flashbacks and tributes that made the movie more of a farewell to both, everything seemed secondary.

I watched this as a double feature with the first back to back and Wakanda Forever is better. I didn't really have high expectations as a lot of Phase 4 productions have disappointed me, and some of the projects that I actually liked were met with criticisms.

End Game carried a lot of emotions a closure to Phase three, this has to be the most devotedly emotional in depth marvel movie, not because of the fan love but because it was written that way. Might not be the best at it but for a superhero movie it was. It was a great way to honor Chadwick and a good movie, I however didn't get that feeling leaving the cinema like I had just seen something special. You know, the way you felt after endgame, even though that's a high bar. The movie still does an impressive job and difficult task bettering it's prequel without it's beloved star, delivering the most emotional take in the MCU thus far.",7/10,11 November 2022,AfricanBro,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Really Good Title. Negative Reviews Are Remedial At Best,"Saw in theaters around day one, just rewatched 4k blue ray, best enthusiast conditions. Sure they compressed the vid a little but that's besides the point..The movie was great, better than the first. For ant man quantumania or freaking Thor Love & Thunder to be similarly rated has to be some amount of sexism or racism. I usually don't say generally exaggerated things like this, but for this case there has to be those undertones. The movie worked with what they had due to chads unfortunate passing, that should be respected. Ontop of this they capitalized with tribute to chad both in the beginning and end. The characters stayed as they were & shuri's strategy was true to her more ""intelligent"" character. The villain was great with good acting and the movie even took risks killing off the queen. Like.. what more do some of these people want? Lol. This was my favorite movie of phase 4. The lower rating of this movie brought similar feelings to when The Last Jedi had a 7 & up rating. It kinda gets you angry in ways lol..

Amazing. Captivating political drama,"So good. They did really well given the difficult circumstances of losing Chadwick Boseman. The whole cast really stepped it up and delivered an amazing performance. Really great soundtrack paired with it, too. A redeeming movie for phase 4.

Less action and more drama than the typical superhero movie, but that's what gave it so much meaning. Really focuses on character development, feelings, intentions, and family. Powerful messages about loss, grief, anger, pain, compassion, and even finding faith.

Surprisingly minimal woke messaging, given its creators (though there was still some, of course).

ONE OF THE BEST MARVEL MOVIES IN A LONG TIME,"A lot of reviews say the first one is better and this one is underwhelming and slow. In my opinion, it was really good and the plot was great. The CGI and action scenes were great. There was also a nice tribute to Chadwick Boseman. THe acting in the movie was really good from all of the characters. I didn't think this movie was slow or boring AT ALL. It was much better than some other recent MCU movies. I don't have a single thing to say bad about this movie. I have seen it twice and I would definitely watch a third, fourth, and fifth time! I really don' see how people think this movie is boring.

After Thoughts,"I feel like my emotional anticipation for this film may have been the reason I was so disappointed in after leaving the theater. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie and I don't want to sour anyone's opinion in watching it. But like with almodt everything in phase 4, temper, temper, temper your expectations. The movie at times can pay beautiful homages to Chadwick Boseman, and then in other times it builds you up and as a viewer and lover of the Marvel films, you feel like it would be a perfect time for another touching moment to reflect on Boseman's legacy, and it will totally drop the ball. And then on top of all that, the story for this feel has to be one of the weakest (except for Thor: Love & Thunder). I feel like Marvel studios thinks that if they put in enough jokes and enough comic references that we will look over lazy writing. But they are wrong! And I am deeply upset that showed that in this film most of all. Letitia Wright was amazing as ever in this film and carried it a lot. But there is only so much she can do. Not the worst in phase 4 but a very apparent drop from what Marvel used to be.

Somehow worse than the 1st one.,"Man...where to start on this disaster of a movie. Losing Boseman really killed the franchise unfortunately and I'd never say a bad word about Chadwick as I thought he was fabulous and perfect as BP. A Black Panther movie without the titular hero didn't seem like a good idea in theory and unfortunately that's what transpired in this film. None of the Wakandan side characters are all that interesting to start with. Their acting (apart from Bassett) is horrible. The girl that played Rori was annoying and extremely unlikable. Namor, however, absolutely crushed it. He kind of carried this awful movie. The director is also horrible. His movies are terrible. The writing was so dumb and there were so many plot holes and mistakes. They should have recasted BP honestly. I think that and a competent director/script are the only things that could have saved this atrocious movie. RIP T'Challa and the MCU.

Women of Will and Worth,"Immediately prominent in this sequel are the strong stories given to its cast of talented black actresses. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia all give powerful performances as their roles were expanded from the original movie. Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.

The new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.

Director Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.

Even though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory. From the specially altered opening credits all the way up to the emotionally-rich mid-credits scene, and all the scenes in between with lines that looked back on the life and extolled the nobility of T'Challa, Boseman was still very much part of this new film.",9/10,9 November 2022,3xHCCH,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Great CG can't make up for a convoluted plot and poor script,"I'm probably the only person willing to tell the truth for fear of being labeled a bigot.

It was beautifully shot and well-acted, but had a unnecessarily convoluted plot/storyline. The CG and action were great, but it seemed like those elements were heightened to cover a poor script.

Upon reflection, this movie creates far more questions than it answers. Also, the motives and reactions of the Talokanil king just weren't believable.

This movie really needed to either be cut down to 2 hours or the plot needed to be much better fleshed out. Action for action's sake never saves a movie that is poorly written.

Definitely better than Black Adam, but just OK.

Most boring Marvel movie yet,"Barely any action and the whole movie felt like a 3 hour Oscar memorial. At least an hour too long with only 3 real action sequences. New Black Panther is not inspiring or even likeable. Comes across as a whinny child. Kept checking my watch while waiting for anything to happen. Namur and his cohorts are not menacing at all. Their design makes them look like a teaser for the sequel to Avatar. New outfits for Okoye looks like a rip off of the Predator except in blue. Doesn't advance the MCU at all. Latest in a recent bunch of poor MCU movies. I long for the good first 10 years of the MCU. Bring back the original six.

Wakanda is the second best movie of Phase 4 after No Way Home,"Pros of the movie: Dora Milage are badass, i love Okoye, Namor (The villian), Soundtrack is great like in the first movie, the actress playing the queen was so good, Mbaku always cool, and the movie takes itself seriously which is breath of fresh air after thor 4, and she hulk...

Cons: IronHeart´s suit is ridiculous, i hope thye improve it. The length of this movie is a bit too long, felt like i was watching the extended version, rather than the theatrical version, and some of the shots in talokan were kinda dark, could have been more lit.

The actress playing the new black panther has a nice compelling arc and makes me root for her as a hero woth being called a hero because of her choice, and not just acll her a hero because she has veen given superpowers.

Where is marvel going,"As many i loved everything that was released by marvel up to and including Endgame. Since then i cant say the same. This is not to say that they didnt handle the death of Chadwick Boseman well. Thats honestly the only redeeming factor in this whole story.

The journey that the story took before even the credits rolled and just shows the range that Letitia Wright has, was totally shown in those first 10 minutes. For the rest these were performances that just seemed that they were taking the cash and running. I cant enjoy a film like this. The only other actor like this was Winston Duke who yet again a fun addition to a very bland film

Story, well its just the same as aquaman but from the opposite point of view! The Oceans were the bad guys and the land were the good guys who didnt have a quick treasure hunt half way through. The whole film was just setting up another story and im slowly losing interest in the MCU if they keep putting these types of stories out.

An incredible tribute to Chadwick,"King T'Challa's statement in the middle of ""Black Panther"" implies that Wakanda has been a superpower for a very long time. Puncturing a meteorite's protective bubble and demonstrating that people are interrelated and that ""better"" can win out was T'Challa's defining act as the king of Wakanda.

The movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is about the razor-thin margins of success and how T'Challa's passing compels the characters to decide between upholding his father's legacy and reigning independently. Breaking from ""Black Panther's"" solitary identity, ""Wakanda Forever"" introduces the rest of the MCU.

Best of Phase 4 and contender for Top 10 MCU,"From the frantic but quiet opening moments, Wakanda Forever feels more real, more grounded and more mature. What unfolds is a layered story worried less about action. The performances all round are truly excellent and you forget this is a mostly women cast (not that it matters) When the action and stakes are ramped up by the third act it feels earned, not just edited in. I love the score, I love the moments of quiet and almost slowness and that it took its time. I loved the comedy sprinkled through. Also the 3D had moments but mostly I didn't notice it. A couple of negatives, runtime feels a little long and I could have done with a little more action but these are nitpicks to what is ultimately a great movie and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Highly recommended.

Nice bridge movie.,"Although not as good as the first one, this movie stands pretty well on its own. Once you watch the ENTIRE movie (hint) you will understand that this movie serves as a bridge to say goodbye to Chad while introducing us to the future of the Black Panther character.

Not a whole lot of action but there was some terrific acting mainly by Angela Bassett with solid performances from the rest of the cast. I liked the actor who played Namor and I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Winston Duke. Mr Duke has the rare ability to be both an action and comedy performer.

Director Coogler had a very difficult task in directing this movie knowing that there would be a lot of real emotions from the fans on how they dealt with the passing of Chad. I think he handled this perfectly in my opinion. At the end of the day there is nothing you can write in a script to replace Chad.

In summary, solid Marvel movie with great acting and BEAUTIFUL cinematography and musical score. Looking forward to what adventures await the Black Panther in the future.",7/10,11 February 2023,cloliver864,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Feels like the work of an overmotivated young cook who has no idea what to do and throws all ingredients into a single dish.,"It's not all bad...with all the money that went into this this would be really sad....but it definitely is not good either and it's nowhere near being excellent, nowhere near the first BP movie (which I liked a lot and I think rated 8 or even 9).

This one is a biiiiig mess, I guess that's the word that describes it best. Feels like the work of an overmotivated young cook who cannot decide what he should serve and puts all ingredients - and lots of it - into one dish.

It's too much in the end, nothing feels right, nothing comes naturally, everything feels forced and wanted and directly out of of a screenwriting brainstorming session under the headline: ""what else could we do, what else could we pack into it?""

You can actually hear them ask: Do we have big and loud a action?

Do we have fun and jokes?

Do we have big feelings and emotions?

Do we have a message for the kids?

Do we have a message for the world?

Do we have a surprise?

Do we have the ethnic diversity right?

Do we have a homosexual element?

But the one person who has a vision and a real story was definitely not in those meetings.

In the end: big style waste of money, thoroughly empty movie and sometimes dialogues that are so bad they make you cringe. It's like pizza with burger and popcorn and cheesecake and some Italian Antipasti put into a mixer.

Nothing short of spectacular.,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10

I'll preface this by stating that I do NOT understand the mixed reviews. There is not one element of this that I would've done differently.

This 2-hour-and-41-minute epic had me hooked from start to finish. No other Marvel property in my opinion, particularly in Phase 4, can match this level of quality, and that's in no small part due to Ryan Coogler, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, and the incredibly talented (not to mention gorgeous) newcomer Tenoch Huerta.

The talent on display in *every single element* of this film is going to be tough to match, even from next month's Avatar: The Way of Water.

Speaking of Avatar 2, they now have some SERIOUS competition in EVERY Oscar category next year, thanks to this film. I could honestly see this sweeping every category and making a strong play for Best Picture.

The acting: Fantastic. Angela Bassett is magnificent. Letitia Wright is wonderful. Tenoch Huerta brings a depth to his Namor that is rare in any film, much less a Marvel one.

I believe he is perhaps an even better incarnation of the already-deep Killmonger from the first film. It's hard not to see the world from his perspective at least once.

The technical craft: Spectacular. I haven't wanted to visit a new world so badly (the underwater world of Talokan) since the first Black Panther sent me to Wakanda and the first Avatar sent me to Pandora. It. Is. Breathtaking.

The score: Unparalleled. Ludwig Goransson has outdone himself with this. It's even better than the first film. It's my favorite score for a movie in years.

The writing and direction: Masterful. Ryan Coogler deserves recognition for elevating this DRAMATICALLY above anything else offered up in Marvel's mixed-bag Phase 4. Coogler manages to make an above-par Marvel epic that has meaningful things to say about loss, grief, sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, and moving on, while also ending on a POWERFUL and prescient note about how nations should treat each other in this post-modern world we all inhabit.

solid film,"The best thing about this film is that it's visually beautiful the setting, the costume design, and the under water world was absolutely gorgeous. The storyline had a nice flow from beginning to end. The action and Sci fi was entertaining. Solid directing and acting. Angela Bassett was the most compelling actor in this film. She carried the first half of this film on her back and it's close to 3 hrs long. She was definitely snubbed at the Oscar's this year. I watched both films and Angela definitely outperformed JLC for supporting actress. Honorable mention also goes to the actor who played Namor (villain). During his scenes I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I hope to see him in more roles. Where the movie lacked was in that tension heart racing feeling that action-dramas are supposed to evoke. Also there was zero comic relief. The film maintained a serious tone all through out, in contrast with other Marvel films. There were maybe 3 or 4 times throughout the 2.41 hr film where they even attempted a joke, and they weren't funny or landed flat. Even with these flaws, overall it's entertaining.

Ending couldn't come soon enough,"Watch At your own risk of being bored Boring Boring Boring The ending couldn't come soon enough. I didn't like it at all one of marvels worst movies yet. They paired with Disney so there you go.

Acting from all actors where half hearted except for Angela basset.

I can see why it didn't do well at the box office it was long and drawn out. I am glad I didn't buy it yet it was on Disney +.

Come on marvel step up your game. Your getting weak.

I kept falling asleep .

Ryan Coogler's Weakest Directorial Effort To Date,"The 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also the concluding chapter of their Phase 4 slate, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever starts on a promising note with an emotional eulogy that exudes honesty & earnestness but when it comes to its own standalone story, there are lot more downs than ups in this bloated, uninvolving mess when compared to its celebrated predecessor.

Co-written & directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station & Creed), the first act of this sequel is where it's at its strongest and the film also does well to make the new antagonist's motivations understandable. However, the plot is thinly spread out over its tedious runtime instead of being consolidated into a tighter narrative and is also undermined by its bland execution, uninspiring action & dry effects.

There is hardly any sense of awe & wonder evident in its spectacle, the underwater kingdom is surprisingly unappealing, and even the action scenes are terribly choreographed. The film was doing better when addressing Wakanda getting challenged by intervening world powers during its state of mourning. Still, the performances help keep things afloat and Angela Bassett steals the show with a commanding showcase.

Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an inferior follow-up that also qualifies as Coogler's weakest directorial effort to date. The story begins with plenty of potential but it fizzles out as it trudges the 161 mins runtime with nothing new or exciting to offer. A mediocre entry in what has been a mediocre phase for Marvel Studios, their latest offering is another forgettable dud in the canon that impresses & entertains in only bits n pieces.",No rating,3 February 2023,CinemaClown,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
"""Black Panther 2"" is beautiful and emotional, but it is not able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each one of the several plots with ideal efficiency","""Black Panther 2"" divides its (ambitious) priorities in such a distant way, the film ends up not being able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each of them with ideal efficiency, making certain key elements of the narrative sound weak and superficial - and it is no surprise that, when the time finally arrives for the protagonist and antagonist to face each other in the third act, the emotional effect caused by that fight never seems to result from an emotional escalation that had been building cohesively throughout the two hours and previous half, sounding, instead, like a technically efficient confrontation, but lacking in dramatic support. To make matters worse, if the 2018 film became an undeniable cultural phenomenon thanks to its surprising thematic ambition and its ability to articulate well the issues it addressed (and which it discussed with remarkable awareness and density), this sequel barely finds time to develop any political topic that it raises with a minimum of depth, collapsing under the weight of its own pretensions - which culminates in a terribly hasty and lazy resolution to the clash between Shuri, Namor and the people they represent (without spoilers, suffice it to say that the script simply decides to throw all the dualities he had been building under the carpet in order to quickly reach an outcome for all that).

In this aspect, even as a ""film about grief"" Black Panther 2 does not fully work, since, instead of establishing the feeling in question as a central (or, at least, constant) piece of the entire narrative, the film only finds opportunities to develop the characters' pain here and there, in specific - and very limited - moments of the projection. That doesn't mean, however, that Coogler doesn't achieve moving results, and if there's something that certainly helps put ""Wakanda Forever After"" above the average of recent Marvel productions, it's the fact that most of the emotions the film attempts provoke sound legitimate, resulting from those that those responsible for the work felt in the first place. Thus, when we see Shuri, for example, crying when remembering her brother, the scene is recorded by Coogler with an introspective and melancholic delicacy that manages to bring the viewer to tears (or a lump in the throat, at least) without ever sounding manipulative or schematic - and, speaking of Shuri, it is important to highlight that Letitia Wright does what she can with great competence in both the scope of the action and the drama to give grandeur and dramatic dimension to a character who, until the previous film, was thought to be almost as a comic relief, being successful in embodying the heroine's suffering and doubts in the face of the role she now assumes, while Angela Bassett, even without starring in any action scenes, establishes herself as the most powerful and intense figure in the entire narrative, evoking Queen Mother Ramonda's pain as she deals not only with the sudden loss of her son, but with the threats made to the people she defends.

Still, the highlight of this sequel isn't even a resident of Wakanda, but rather the underwater Namor, who takes on the role of the story's real antagonist even without ever becoming a villain. Presented by Ryan Coogler as an individual who, at first glance, does not exude any trace of intimidation (which is interesting, as it creates in the viewer the expectation that that character will be portrayed in a more ""stripped down"" way than the film eventually comes to believe). Portray, making his radical actions even more surprising than they already would be), the king of Talokan is played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía as a suitably unpredictable figure, being efficient as well as demonstrating a legitimate affection for the people he defends ( notice the pain that takes over his face when witnessing the loss of a subject), he also conveys intransigence and threat by vowing to exterminate those who get in his way - or harm him in any way.

Obviously, one of the reasons for this change was to distance the character from DC's rival, Aquaman (Jason Momoa). Although Aquaman was inspired by Namor in the comics, the DC character debuted on the big screen before. So, to avoid criticism and accusations from those who don't know the stories, this distance from each other is quite logical. Furthermore, betting on Talocan instead of Atlantis is even a matter of coherence in the MCU, since Greek myths and legends were justified by Eternals (2021). And since they didn't even mention the existence of Namor, it makes sense that they move away from this mythology and focus on an underwater kingdom inspired by Mayan traditions. While Atlantis in ""Aquaman"" was excessively bright and colorful, Talocan has more sober and dark lighting, replicating the feeling of diving into an underwater cave. Not that it bothers you, but after building so many vibrant and colorful magical worlds, it's a brief disappointment that they don't explore the vibrant colors of Mesoamerican art as much to create this kingdom. On the other hand, the water movement of the people is more visually interesting than that proposed by the DC rival. In fact, this society's approach is much more credible. The customs, traditions, and activities of the people on a daily basis. The entire concept of the existence of this population is very well constructed and believable, exploring marine elements and animals as a functional part of this civilization. And as this is just the introduction of this nucleus, there is a colossal expectation for what could be shown in the future.

What's more: the fact that he is the leader of a civilization of Aztec origins is fundamental to establish him as a counterpoint to the warriors of Wakanda, since, while this is an African nation that stood out precisely by resisting European colonization, Talokan is an civilization that (literally) succumbed due to the barbarities committed by the Spanish invaders, positioning one fictional country as a distorted reflection of the other - and, therefore, it is appropriate that costume designer Ruth E. Carter brings elements of Aztec culture to the costumes of the Talokanians and that production designer Hannah Beachler portrays the underwater kingdom as an abandoned, uncomfortable environment that only seems to endure thanks to its occupants' persistence in clinging to every scrap of past life they have left, sounding radically different from the hidden paradise that is Wakanda. (That at a given moment a North American agent sees some Talokanian soldiers and, without understanding who they are, deduces that ""They must be the Wakandans"" is something that exposes an obviously racist and generalist view on the part of that person towards foreign peoples - in a comment subtle but effective social-political aspect on the part of the film.) On the other hand, not even this justifies the excessive darkness that takes over most of the night and/or underwater sequences - and there are moments when it is almost impossible to see what is happening in the scene, even when that clearly wasn't Ryan Coogler or cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw's intention.

The biggest issue to be addressed in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" comes from the title itself: if, on the one hand, it takes too long until, finally, a new Black Panther is presented (and, finally, it only appears two hours after the beginning of the film, which in total is more than 180 minutes long) - and, when it happens, it is more due to the conjuncture of events than the result of a natural process of awareness and calling - little attention is also given to the continuity of Wakanda as a state - and cultural phenomenon. After all, since the object they possess, coveted by so many, will not be shared, these others try to divert their attention elsewhere. The clash, therefore, is between the USA and Talokan, without the former, in fact, even being aware of the existence of the latter. Wakanda was just unlucky enough to be in the middle of this dispute. All Namor would have to do was defend what is his, and that's it. What is the need, therefore, to go into confrontation against the only people also in possession of the same benefit? Watching Wakandeans and Talokeans face off is not only disappointing, it's manipulative. After all, there are two oppressed peoples - in an extra-filmic spectrum, it is Latins against Africans - killing each other, while the explorers (North Americans) remain at a safe distance, waiting for the first casualty to collect the remains. Of battle, like profiteering hyenas.

As entertainment - it is important not to forget that, after all, it is a superhero film based on comic book characters - ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a delight to the eyes, right from the action scenes (Namor demonstrates a strong which deserves to be better utilized in the future), as well as the composition of new scenarios (the underwater world of Talokan is stunning). However, the very points highlighted in this paragraph make the best of the set clear: the newcomers from the bottom of the sea, and not the palace intrigues in a kingdom in the heart of Africa, which would be expected. Both Bassett and Nyong'o could have been explored better, and in the end, there are so many loose ends - what is Okoye's future? What does M'Baku want? What is Martin Freeman doing in the middle of all this? - that what is certain is that only one of the original intentions was achieved. Boseman is gone, and the grief at this unexpected departure is felt from beginning to end. However, not in a way that takes the whole thing forward, as seen in ""Fast and Furious 7 (2015)"", for example. On the contrary, it was made like an anchor, preventing such progress. And as it turned out, it's good not to play with what comes from the depths.",7/10,8 January 2024,fernandoschiavi,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
A dump-all-in film,"Black Panther was a great success for Marvel and Chadwick Boseman had a great future as an MCU hero, but then he died. In order to somehow fix this broken continuity, Wakanda Forever was born, but it feels like a movie made by committee (which it probably was). It has good acting, but choppy plot. It has things appearing out of nowhere when the story needs them and characters that behave inconsistently throughout the film. It has problems in editing! At one point the music just glitches because they removed a scene late in postproduction, probably. It has women of color running everything: Black female Panther, Black female Ironman, Black female Black Widow, Black female Queen. It's not that it hurts the story in anyway, but it gives the impression that they dumped everything they had in this film just to make it not suck. I mean, they added Mexicans, too. They were trying to take the Wakandan jobs. Ok, bad joke, but the whole concept felt more racist than whatever I can say.

It's not a totally bad movie, taken as a standalone, but in the context of so much source material and so many previous good MCU films, it does suck. The best part was Lupita Nyong'o. Her character weas interesting and she is so beautiful!

In the end they drop a post-credits scene that ensures the possibility of a replacement for Chadwick, but I don't see how, unless they add some ""go to ancestral land and return 20 years older"" plot.

Bottom line: compared to the first Black Panther movie, this film was accompanied by overwhelming silence. It's easy to find things to make fun of in it, but the fact that not many people even bothered says a lot. This is a run of the mill, committee approved flatliner.",7/10,7 February 2023,siderite,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
Probably one of the best written UCM movies.,"It was a journey through pain, tears, revenge, healing and reconciliation. We can feel the silent path that Shuri has to traverse and we feel every inch of it.

There are some parts that make me uncomfortable, but in the end it is part of the construction of the plot. My feelings don't matter in the face of what the movie does well.

Magnificent direction by Coogler, a soundtrack that hits the spot. Incredible, absolutely incredible. The movie deceived me with its apparently complex structure, the conflict between the three nations is somewhat latent and the fear is relentless.

The film builds itself beautifully. It doesn't feel weird, it's completely genuine and the writing is brilliant.

Nothing more to say. The best written movie in the MCU.",9/10,10 November 2022,Jairito-4444,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),POSITIVE
Loved it BUT....,"I loved this film in so many ways. Tribute was done perfectly and villain casting was a bullseye. Story was great as well but I feel Nakia should have been the new Black Panther. As a spy with more fight experience and seasoned in the game would have made a far better fit. I didn't find final climax between Namar & Panther wasn't believable at all. He had decades of fight experience which showed easily in his fight choreography and she was by far outmatched but the film did require she be victorious but wasn't done in a way could believe. Leaving sister as tech genius would have made for a better story. That's the only issue I had with this project/film and why I rated it a 7.5/10..

Loved it!,"This was such a fun movie to watch. It was long, but didn't feel longer than a regular movie. There was a lot of action, but also great character exposition. I don't want to give anything away, but I loved the novel perspective on leadership this one evolved to. Also the contrast between how different Black Panthers inhabit that role, and the implications of that.

I loved the new world discovered, with its own mythology, and the way those two worlds can come together, for good or ill. I can't wait to see where the story goes next.

Beautiful scenes and fun story with great characters. And the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, both his character and the actor, were deeply moving and tastefully done. Great soundtrack too. Just all around a great way to spend an afternoon with the family.

Well made but overlong and goes nowhere,"I would say this film exceeds 'Black Panther'(2018) in terms of effects, as the cgi and practical blend together alot better and are generally of higher quality. The characters are well written and the film has it's moments.

Namor was amazing and written with complete respect to the character from the comics.

Wakanda Forever is however far too long and it really feels like the story goes nowhere, with strands to be picked up by future marvel projects or another Black Panther sequel.

The film honours Chadwick Boseman well and I think Ryan Cooper did a very good job, having lost the main star and rewriting the entire film in a limited time.

Absolutely dreadful sequel,"The only reason I watched ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was because of my obligatory completionist mindset of watching ALL MCU movies that gets put out, and in return I have to sit through pure garbage like this, I mean come on. What even was this?

First of all, this movie focused way too much on the loss of the late great Chadwick Boseman and instead of just using a short time on that and the rest on the plot, they instead focused mostly on Chadwick and very little on plot. It's truly a shame. But i'm not even that mad, since I did expect this little from this awful sequel.

On top of that, it was very unnecessarily long. I felt like I wasted 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life which i'll never get back. Everything after Endgame sucks, and this is by far no exception. This might even be up there for my least favorite MCU movie, right up there with Eternals and Black Widow. Also, let's not talk about the awful casting of Namor. Absolutely dreadful, don't recommend.",2/10,1 February 2023,darapjohnson,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),NEGATIVE
Pretty good,"I want to get it from the beginning.

The funeral scene and a fast-starting intro definitely kept the movie at a good pace. While we haven't learned a few things about T'Challa, a script has been created that will truly honor the memory of the esteemed Chadwick Boseman.

Secondly, the Queen's speech scene and her attempt to protect her country were another of the fine details. Here, today's ""secret colonialism"" plans have been a beautiful reflection on the screen.

Apart from that, Shuri's heavy role caused me to have very sudden and vague thoughts in my thoughts about her. I can't say whether it's positive or negative. But it's definitely a deep feeling. Having flashbacks, self-development, ambition and effort to find oneself were some of the positive aspects I saw. The only scene about Shuri that surprised me was that Killmonger one.

I also liked the heavy load that Namor was carrying and the reflection of that. But I think this character, who was skeptical and unstable from the beginning, made a ridiculous comeback at the end of the movie. I liked the character, but not his decisions.

Unfortunately, it was Nakia who took on the uncertain and mostly negative parts. I really appreciate the character. But the Queen's mistakes in doing her will put the story in a difficult position. Apart from that, I also experienced things that did not fit my mind in the parts about T'Challa JR.

Despite all this, the movie really moved me and made me happy at the same time. I had a lot more fun than the first movie. My favorite character will always be M'Baku anyways :))

The Black Panther lives!,"Ryan had already completed the script for a black panther to when Chadwick Boseman tragically passed away. It's a devastating loss, and Coogler and the rest of the cast and crew were reeling from that loss. Coogler made a genius writing choice by making the characters in Wakanda Forever go through the the exact same emotions that the actors themselves went through. All the characters in this film are struggling to come to terms with a loss that they did not expect nor do they fully understand it. In that way we immediately relate to them and are sucked into the story because we as audience and fans of Chadwick feel the exact same way. Coogler made the absolute best of an heartbreaking situation.

Wakanda Forever is a geopolitical drama about loss, grief, pain, revenge, suffering and healing - all in the disguise of a blockbuster. Unbelievable performances by the entire cast. Especially Angela Basset, Letitia Wright & Tenoch Huerta. Basset portrays the role of the struggling queen, the grieving mother so believable und raw it's tour de force of acting. Wright also has to relieve every single emotion an actor can show I was completely blown away by her as I did not except that a previous supporting character could carry a movie so well. Lupita Nyong'o as usual is phenomenal, with every scene she's in she injects an extra load of charisma and life into the movie. Her presence is mesmerizing. Danai Gurira's Okoye and Dominique Thorne's Riri bring the humor and laughs to the film, and they were great.

And oh boy Marvel Studios just put a new superstar on the field - Tenoch Huerta as Namor is a delight! Raw, almost mystical, full of energy and power. A worthy follow up to the amazing Killmonger. Talocan's introduction is a highlight of the movie, it may be even more fascinating than Wakanda's introduction in the first movie. So visually dazzling, creative and rich in Detail.

The VFX scenes where Namor is attacking ships don't look good in parts even unfinished which I found frustrating at times especially because the rest of the movie looks so beautiful.

The movie constantly thrives on the cathartic, wonderful, touching and unbelievably atmospheric directing and writing by Ryan Coogler. Ludwig Göransson's score is absolutely incredible. There's a scene in the ancestral plane, it's my favorite moment in the movie - the setup, timing, dialogue and exposition here are peak cinema. Chadwick Boseman's spirit radiates through the whole movie. Everything is build around him, his character and the legacy he left. Coogler and his team honored Chad in the most beautiful and respectful way possible. This is a movie that transcends it's medium. It something very special that will be remembered forever. Chad would be proud.

Terrible,"Was such a boring movie only thing that was entertaining was laughing at how stupid the plot line was. All the fighting, destruction and death was completely avoidable if only they had the same sense at the start of the movie. Also how does a 19 year old just build an iron man suit in a random garage when it took one of the smartest people in the marvel universe billions and state of the art technology? Takes away all the credit for how special iron man really was. They also tried to recreate the same scene from iron man where she goes so high up she loses consciousness and wakes up just before landing in the water. I'm really worried for marvel because the new thor movie was almost as bad. Only good side was the actors.

If you want to sleep for 2 and a half hours in a big room filled with people go ahead watch this trash.

they tried but just couldn't replicate the magic,"Fans are taken back into the world of Wakanda where its citizens mourn the passing of King T'Challa, meanwhile intellectual Shuri, fierce Okoye, and noble Ramonda do their best to protect their homeland from intervening world powers. Despite the frequent globetrotting and a few surprises for longtime fans, the story isn't very captivating, in fact it's too long with far too much exposition, and much of the humor feels out of place. Give props to Coogler for taking on the unenviable task of crafting a sequel without his former lead actor Chadwick Boseman whose untimely death forced things to go in a much different direction, but his absence shows glaringly cause even though Bassett, Gurira, and especially Wright step up, other returning characters are underutilized, the new characters are not fully realized, and a major subplot makes one wonder if Marvel is trying to outclass DC for supremacy under the sea. **

Good ideas wasted,"This movie comes with some great ideas, most of the times you're watching it thinking about the next move or the next segment of the story, but the pace of the story is always interrupted by scenes that feel completely out of place.

This brings to the core issue, the length of the picture is 2 hours and 43 minutes, with a messy pace and very hard to follow fight scenes, it gets boring really fast, and very predictable up until the end, where we get to see yet another incomprehensible fight scene, and a very weak ending to the story.

Visually stunning at times, but relies way too much on CGI and green screen, sometimes shots feel unfinished, to the a degree it gets laughably bad.

The score by Ludwig Goransson was very good, incredibly wild and truly dramatic when it needed to be.

Umm...,"**Spoilers Ahead**

Black Panther 2 was bound to happen give or take whatever would happen to Chadwick Boseman; it was a cynical approach to an impossibly bold undertaking to cinema's most successful black superhero and have a sequel... without the main star at all.

Wakanda Forever doesn't feel like a film that's gonna be immortalised like some of Marvel's previous entries, but feels like ANOTHER film to fulfill that sweet yearly content quota for Disney. Yes the story was interesting, yes it paid homage to Chadwick well, but the film feels like an empty tribute piece that... undermines ALL of its respect with THAT twist at the ending of the movie.

Long story short: T'Challa has a kid, who was willed into existence between this movie and the first Black Panther. Okay, not really, but when Chadwick was still alive, the film was gonna be a father-and-son centric story. But the way the film uses that plot strand as a tease for future movies felt like it was a well-intended homage that ended up coming off as tone-deaf 'sequel insurance' that doesn't do Boseman any posthumous service.

Anyway, Black Panther 2 isn't bad, but the circumstances of THIS film and The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy after Carrie Fisher died when The Last Jedi was completed but never lived to see Episode IX done: it's a weirdly frustrating dilemma filling the void of a widely beloved, and passed, talent and pressing on with a fully completed sequel regardless. Loss of movie characters are hard, but losing the actors is SO MUCH harder; for all of us.

It seems like Marvel is still trying to figure out its mojo post-Endgame, and it's gonna keep trying to find it even if a lot of this stuff seems too 'pre-determined' as escapism goes in the cinema these days.

P. S. We REALLY miss you, Chadwick. Gone too soon, but never forgotten.

Too heavy handed,"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.

Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.

The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?

The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.

What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.

"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.

It was depressing,"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.

I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.

"Amazing Cast & Set, but the political message was too strong","I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.

The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.

( SPOILERS AHEAD )

Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..

A Hot Pink Mess,"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.

The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.

The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.

If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.

Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.

Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.

If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.

A Technicolor Dream,"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.

The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.

I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?

Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.

Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.

The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.

What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.

The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie,"I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.

Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.

I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""

The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.

And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.

It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.

Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.

Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.

Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.

I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.

Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.

Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.

Somewhat of a Jumbled Mess,"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.

As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.

The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.

Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.

Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.

Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.

By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equality

This movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.

On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.

The HYPE is not real,"It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.

People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.

In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.

I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie. But otherwise, Bravo!",9/10,1 August 2023,surfacing7,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.

Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""

The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.

When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.

I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.

However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.

Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.

Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.

If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.

But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6/10,24 July 2023,lokicola,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
not for everyone,"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.

OVERHYPED,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.

I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!

Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).

Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!,"8.5/10 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",8/10,19 July 2023,HabibieHakim123,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
It could have been so much better...,"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.

Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.

Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.

It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.

"Some humorous moments, but the story fell flat","Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.

Fun and surprisingly touching,"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.

Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.

Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.

Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.",8/10,19 July 2023,jpismyname,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
My mom and I saw this yesterday. Here are my thoughts.,"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.

I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.

There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.

The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.

There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.

There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.

The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.

I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.

This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.

"""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism","I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.

Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:

In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.

With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.

Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.

Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?

Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.

In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",8/10,19 July 2023,andypaps101,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
"Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing","Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.

Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.

Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.

Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.

Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.

Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.

You are Kenough,"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.

There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.

I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.

Too overrated,"Its like watching at ""Truman's show"" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.

Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.

I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes. Although I excepted to hear the Aqua song! Why it wasn't played in the movie.

Anyway its not a bad movie, it's just good movie.

A triumph of marketing for a poorly realised story,"It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.

This highlights the movie's sloppy construction, it doesn't know what it wants to be.

The movie starts with a homage to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey resulting in every child rejecting baby dolls. What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.

A chase scene in an office makes no sense.

A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.

Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.

Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in? One of many 'jokes' that fails to land such as the cartoon car crashes, the boardroom whisper gag among others.

The movie has some cute moments having people enact doll play.

That absence of internal logic reveals this movie has no idea what it wants to be.",4/10,14 August 2023,stusby,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.,"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.

The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!

3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.,"The first reason to go see it:

It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.

Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.

The second reason to go see it:

It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.

The third and best reason to go see it:

I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!

They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!

The only reason AGAINST seeing it:

If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.

Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!

Did I watch the same movie as everyone else lol,"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.

Honestly - not funny and light enough,"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.

I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.

"Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worlds","I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?

Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.

Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.

Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.

While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.

The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.

The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.

Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6/10,19 July 2023,mark-217-307033,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
No Direction,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",6/10,21 July 2023,andermic18,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
A colorful love letter to human kind,"I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.

Excellent marketing team.,"They really did some fantastic marketing with this movie.

It's not exactly bad. It's just mediocre. It's very pretty to look at, and some of the music is actually quite funny and fitting.

But this is nowhere near what was advertised, it's not a fun jokey movie that brought homage to old movies, some saterical jokes etc. It's that, followed by story with heaaaavy messaging, followed again by a quick joke.

However none of it is funny or interesting enough to justify its runtime. The ending in particular was very obvious and just kept going, it's so clear they want you to feel something but you don't. It's just not interesting enough with the story they out forth and how long the ""ending"" goes on for.

Overrated and sad,"I saw this recently on streaming after hearing so much hype about how it was so important and such an incredible movie. After I watched it I wondered if I'd ordered the wrong movie. The whole thing was just lame unfunny jokes, a convoluted plot line, bland acting and mixed messaging which seems to be trying to be positive for women but are unintentionally negative - especially at the end with how the Barbies trick the Kens, I mean is the positive message for my daughter meant to be to exploit men by buttering them up? Er what?

Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do.

The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me. Which is ironic given it was meant to be a movie about empowering women.

Disappointing and I expect this movie to be re evaluated as bad in the future.",2/10,8 October 2023,SarahAppleSauce98,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
We're All Dolls,"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?

And more importantly where would we find ourselves?

In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.

Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.

There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.

To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.

We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.

The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.

A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.",8/10,28 July 2023,klastaitas,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Didn't live up to expectations,"I watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes, but I talked her into watching it - ""It'll get better, honey. They'll be going into the real world, soon.""

Well, it didn't get better, after they went into the real world. I feel like it was a better show in Barbieland where it seemed more realistic.

There isn't anything wrong with the acting or production, but the script is weak, particularly when they get to the real world. People just don't act like that. I'm disappointed for the actors, I think they thought it would be a great movie, however it's much more of a letdown.

Preach Preach Preach,"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.) I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.

No questions just answers,"The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.

However, the opening scene is great (if you know the reference, of course), and there are some funny moments. But they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it.

Not made for me but loved nonetheless,"As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.

I don't see how it was preachy,"In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.

So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!

It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.

The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.

But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.

Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .",9/10,4 August 2023,thePopcornExplorer,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Quite disappointing,"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.

I am Kenough,"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.

So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.

The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.

There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10.",8/10,23 July 2023,eoinageary,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Interesting concept but not as deep as expected,"The movie isn't as fantastic as it was hyped to be. Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of ""girls can do anything"" and ""find yourself."" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it's essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood's consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world's most profit-driven film industry.

Preacher Barbie?,"I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was ""Sanctimonious Barbie.""

I had no expectations but was still underwhelmed,"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.

The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.

Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!

Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.

Not what I Expected,"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.

Loved it!,"Barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life pre-determined. She goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend Madeline. The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.

Boring Movie,"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.

Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.

Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.

There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass.

Well deserving of the hype,"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.

The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.

Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.

I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.

Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.",10/10,21 July 2023,eleanorcrawlings,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Not so unique as expected,"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.

It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.

Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.

If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.

Best for Ryan Gosling Gives a really great performance acting,"I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.

Especially if anyone is a Barbie fan, let me tell you, this event is very satisfying.

Even I'm not looking fun. And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.

Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.

This is another very good performance for this man.

What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic. Let's just say the story is like we're playing with dolls and assuming the role of that character...",9/10,19 July 2023,mckai-89546,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Misleading.,"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.

Overhyped and banal,"The film does not live up to the marketing. Its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle. There must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this film.

The music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween. ""Yay feminism"" is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film. It doesn't offer up anything to think about, just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toys.

With all the ""Barbenhiemer"" hype and marketing I expected more from the movie, Oppenheimer and Barbie are about as polar opposites of film-making as its possible to get.

It's beautiful.,"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.

"Great for the first 30 minutes, then not","The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.

There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:
Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)
Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girl
Barbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to be


Instead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality.

More of a marketing flick,"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.

Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.

The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10 It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.

Brilliantly done!,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this. At the very beginning I thought it would be a pointless film of how perfect you should look and how you should act a certain way in order for society to like you.

How wrong I was!

I thought the script was hilarious but also inspirational. One moment I was laughing then the next tearing up.

The actors done such an amazing job!

Ryan Gosling as Ken was such a good choice he played it brilliantly.

My Daughter loved it and came away with the right message that you shouldn't have to fit in to any type of box that you should just be you as that's enough!",10/10,1 August 2023,tinajenko-33312,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
A nostalgic trip to our feelings,"Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go.

Just a little empty,"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.

Another Greta masterpiece,"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.

Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.

Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.

And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.

Could be better,"Completely forgot to review this, the sets are easily the best they're really gorgeous to look at, the characters are fun to watch and the characters are all really enjoyable. The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.

"Barbie, Swing and a Miss","This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.

The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.

Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.

Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.

In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.

One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.

In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.

Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.

Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.

Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.

Absolutely powerful movie and changed my perspective on life,"This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.

Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.

Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.

Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.

Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....

Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.

Uneven but fun enough to mildly recommend it,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I guess i made i right choice when i chose to watch ""Oppenheimer"" instead of ""Barbie"" (2023) during the time when these two movies have dominated the worldwide box office. After watching it now at home i can say that I'm a bit disappointed for it because two previous movies made by Greta Gerwig ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were amazing. Given the high rating from critics, i found this movie not to be as good. Sure its fun and collorfull and features great cast, but humor is uneven, jokes are a miss and hit and i didn't like any of soundtracks honestly. ""Barbie"" tries to be a bit multilayered and because of bittersweet ending i liked it a bit more.

Overall, ""Barbie"" is a highly uneven movie. Its fun and colorful and different enough to recommend it for one evening, and i guess they did their best with this material.

Disappointing and misleading,"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.

For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.

For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.

In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.",5/10,19 July 2023,enesmil,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Surprisingly great,"Barbie the movie was much better and with more character, story quality and depth than I expected. I went into the movie to see what the fuss was about and for a bit of something fun to do and left feeling happy the rest of the day, thinking about its story a lot, the interesting execution and styling. I also played the soundtrack which has some great songs.

To me movie turned out to not be preachy or about being feminist. I think the people who think so are misinterpreting that. At its heart, and this movie does have heart, it ties to Mattel's slogan and concept for Barbie products - You Can Be Anything. It's about finding out who you are and feeling empowered to be yourself, whatever that may be.

It's a unique style of film and one I thoroughly found myself enjoying. I find myself wanting to see it again already.

If you're in doubt whether to go and see this movie go, if you are like me and some other reviewers I've seen you may come away feeling glad you did.",No rating,8 August 2023,medekfan,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Good...not great,"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.

The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.",7/10,29 July 2023,planktonrules,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun,"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.

For a very basic overview, ""Barbie"" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.

In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""Barbie"". A mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.

Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""Barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with ""Barbie"", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.

""Barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!

Not only do I feel that ""Barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""The Flash"", ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1"", & ""Oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience.",10/10,1 August 2023,zkonedog,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
It was good but far too preachy,"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.

The best version of itself,"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.

Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.

Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.

Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.

America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.

Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.

The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.",10/10,21 July 2023,masonsaul,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
This film isn't saying what it thinks it is,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.

Didn't hit my pink spot,"My Review - Barbie In Cinemas now My Rating 6.5/10

I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.

I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.

How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I just didn't get it ?

Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .

Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.

The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.

No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.

Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?

Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?

Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.

Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?

The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .

I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.

I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .

It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.

Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .

Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.

Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.

Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.

Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.

I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.

Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,

"Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one","I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.

Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.

Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity: * some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.

* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.

* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.

In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!",4/10,25 July 2023,Dello_,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Speechless,"Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.",10/10,7 August 2023,Reyniday,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Great acting but why this movie?,"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.

Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.

"Charming, fun and we all had a laugh.","This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was hilarious and we all had a laugh. Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right. Honestly hats off to all casts & crew. I LOVED THIS!!!

I would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute TV sitcom,"Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.

Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling ""Ken doll"" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie's vision of the changing world.

The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.

All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. It would not surprise me to see a TV producer turn this Barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute TV sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold Mrs. Shullivan and my own attention for.

I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 IMDb rating.",6/10,27 December 2023,Ed-Shullivan,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
I already need to see it again!,"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!

Had some good moments but that's it,"I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.

Ryan Gosling's performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.

On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.

Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song ""I'm just Ken"" should be nominated for the academy's ""Best Original Song"" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.

The story overall could have been better.

Wow. SO much hype...for this?,"We waited until it came out on streaming, because nobody in the family was that invested in it. But because it was such a cultural phenomenon, we all did want to see it eventually, to understand the hype. Besides the very specific parts that everyone else has panned (the Mattel executives bits, the Ruth Handler bits), I simply found it...dull. We watched the whole thing, found nothing to discuss in the usual post-movie family recap, and went on about our lives. When the Oscars noms were announced and Barbie got nominated in the music categories, I couldn't even remember any songs! Oh yes, then I remembered that dance thing at the beginning (where Barbie has her 'death' comment). Okay, it had a song. Then when I saw Gosling singing at the Oscars I remembered there was that song too. I simply found the whole thing utterly unmemorable, like a weak dream forgotten upon awakening.

"Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!","This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!

This Barbie is dissapointed.,"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".

But wouldn't you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just ""ok"". Just that.

Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.

Bafflingly mediocre,"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.

For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here.",4/10,21 July 2023,nwsquadron,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Kentastic!,"I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.",8/10,5 August 2023,jaysnewish,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
Did I just watch a 2hr Mattel advertisement?,"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.

A Beautiful Commentary on the Real World,"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.

While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.

As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.

Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!

It's alright,"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all"" And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.

I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.

Solid 6/10, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.

I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.

Yes,"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)

ABUSE OF THE BARBIE,"Here's the thing.

In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.

Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.",6/10,25 July 2023,silvangigerstudio,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trap,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.

Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.

Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.

Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.",3/10,20 July 2023,Azureus91,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Unexpectedly totally awesome,"When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers. I didn't even have a look at the trailer in this case so I really didn't know what to expect from Barbie.

But it's a gorgeous masterpiece, clever, surprisingly deep. People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.

The full message is round up at the very end.

I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.

The set was out of this world. The costume designs were awesome.

Performances by Margot, Ryan, America were fantastic. The rest was great too.

Can't wait to see it again <3.",10/10,25 July 2023,jillweeland,Barbie (2023),POSITIVE
"Witty, funny but severly sterotypical","A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.

The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.

In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.

This movie tries to be too much,"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.

All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.

I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.

I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.

I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.

Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.",4/10,24 July 2023,brianjohnson-20043,Barbie (2023),NEGATIVE
Touching and educational,"This movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion. Literally. I don't care if you don't like Barbies or pink, because this movie is so much more than that. It makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is. The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn't necessarily a kids movie even though it's called ""Barbie"", a doll. It didn't have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.

Overall, absolutely beautiful movie and really touching. It's not only about toys, it's about life. Go watch it!

I will for sure keep listening to I'm Just Ken!,"I thought Barbie would be much more childish than it was. At the beginning of the film, I thought about what I was actually watching. It started out childish, but then it turned out that it is aimed at a more adult audience. Many of the jokes in the film will not be understood by children. There were parts of the film that I liked and parts that I loathed. It is well directed and has lovely singing and dancing that sticks in one's head, especially the song at the end, I'm Just Ken. Loved it.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling fit perfectly in their roles as Barbie and Ken and give a very good performance. The comedy and jokes didn't always land with me, but at least I laughed a few times during the movie. Will Ferrell is almost always funny, which he was here. But, the whole part with the real world and all the corporate guys with their suits, felt out of place because they were just as childish as Barbieland.

The film also has a deeper message, where it presents interesting arguments about how the invention of Barbie has affected the world, for better and for worse. Personally, I think that the film lost my interest a bit when there was far too much talk about ""strong women"".

Barbie was better than I thought it would be, but overall it was an okay movie. Not sure I want to watch it again though. However, I will for sure keep listening to I'm Just Ken!

Murphy is exceptional,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",9/10,19 July 2023,Orlando_Gardner,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
"A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.

But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.

The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.

I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).

I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.

Quality but exhausting,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.

I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.

All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.

And the Oscar goes to...,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",10/10,19 July 2023,mark-217-307033,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.

During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.

Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.

For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.

The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.

It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.

I rate it a perfect 10/10.",10/10,20 July 2023,MrDHWong,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Is it just me ?,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.

"Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short","I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.

Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!

THE GREAT +++

Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.


The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.


Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.


Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.


Many poignant time jump edits.


The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.


Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.


In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.


THE NOT SO GREAT ---

A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.


The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.


Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.

Severely overhyped,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.

I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.

The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.

A Cinematic Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.

Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.

Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.

The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.

The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.

Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.

When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.

Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.

After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.

I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",10/10,19 July 2023,Dvir971,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE

This just might be as interesting as this topic can get,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.

This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.

It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.

It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.

We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .

It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?

Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.

Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.

For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.

Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.

Edit:

I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.

The Imitation Game.

A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.

The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.

Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!

Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!

The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!

"Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way","Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.

I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.

Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.

For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.

There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.

Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.

Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.

Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.

In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.

True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.

Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.

There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.

Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.

Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.

After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.

And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.

There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.

Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.

Highly overrated,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.

Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?

The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.

There are far too many characters.

Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.

The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.

Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.

Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",5/10,25 July 2023,bartlooman,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
Nolan at his best!,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.

The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.

Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.

Mixed feelings,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.

Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.

Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.

Simply amazing,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.

Cinematic masterpiece,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.

Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.

You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.

Technically superb but...,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.

There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.

The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.

I wish there were more moments like that...

If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.

However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.

To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.

Quite boring,"There are a few other reviews here echoing the same sentiments. I asked the people sitting next to me what they thought and they were disappointed. I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.

Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??

The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored.

"Good movie, but don't let Nolan fans fool you.","It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.

Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.

The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.

It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.

"No doubt a well made story, but overall, was just boring","Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.

And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.

As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",6/10,13 August 2023,ryan-beauchesne,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
no amount of dramatic music or quick cuts could convince me I was being entertained,"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.

Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.

Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.

Oppen-bore-mer,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.

The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.

However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.

The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.

It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.

A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fear,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.

FUTURE CLASSIC and EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MOVIE FOR THE PRESENT DAY,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!

This movie is the bomb!,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.

All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.

My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.

I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",8/10,20 July 2023,zeki-4,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Not really sure what to think.,"The movie was ok. There were some cool scenes, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and excellent sound design.

The problem I really had with the movie was the sex scenes. They felt out of place. It was shocking to say the least seeing that in the theater. I looked away to be honest because I didn't really want to see that. I don't think it was crucial to the story, there are certainly ways to imply what happened without explicitly showing things.

I love Christopher Nolan's movies. I think he is a fantastic filmmaker. For me, this film just didn't hit the mark. I felt more taken out than anything because of some of the content. I still have mixed feelings and I'm not sure what to think.

Movie of the Year (?),"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.

The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.

Too loud and too long,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.

There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.

Film of the decade,"Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.

As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.

Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.

For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning.

Nothing special,"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon.

Confusing!,"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that.

Particle for direct object CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.

"Murphy is Amazing, But Downey Jr Steals The Show","I just got out of Oppenheimer

I have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.

But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.

Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.

Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.

Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.

I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.

This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toilet

For me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love.",8/10,21 July 2023,slightlymad22,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Murphy and Nolan - An Explosive Combination,"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb.

WATCH IT IN IMAX!!!,"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece!

The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it.

This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.

RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.

This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.

The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.

If you had any doubt watching it, don't hesitate!

WATCH IT IN IMAX AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LEAVE THE THEATER WITH THE BEST IMAX EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD!

"His eyes look full of fear, regrets and guilt!","Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.

Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.

""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.

He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.

Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.

The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.

Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.

Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.

That is all from me. Thank you.

I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.

Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.

My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.

This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.

Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.

This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.

Story about a security clearance,"The story is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, lovingly called Oppie, who is (maybe) wrongfully suspected of being a security risk, a suspicion cunningly used by another man who doesn't like Oppie, and therefore Oppie loses his security clearance, but later the second man experiences consequences of his unjust behaviour. Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S. Truman.

Less would have been more,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.

"No. So disappointed by this grossly overhyped, sad film","Nolan made the telling of the story as complicated as he possibly could... as is his way. Made it a story of McCarthy inquisition and told the story of the Manhattan project via a sequence of flashbacks to overdramatised moments with actors expressing pithy cliches. Turned the story of the biggest applied R&D project in history and development of applied atomic science into an individual cult of personality and a bureaucratic conspiracy. Not the story I tuned in for, and i struggle to believe this found any sort of broad audience. Nice suits, great lighting, overbearing music, a very long and tediously, implausibly dramatised telling of a significant history.

Mini serie would have been a better way to go,"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.

Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.

The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.

I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.

Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.

Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.

The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.

As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.

Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.

"Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.","""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.

The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.

The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.

The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.

It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.

The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.

Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",10/10,19 July 2023,rayanenaffati,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Oppenheimer - Jamison Slabaugh,"This is one of Christopher Nolan's best thrilling rides he has directed. The cast in this film is fantastic and the acting performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing in this film. Ludwig Goransson made one of his best scores for this film. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. The set designs and builds are amazing as well. The way the story is put together with seeing Oppenheimer's story from the begging the middle and the end all at once. The idea and tension that is built up when they talk about how the atmosphere could possibly light up and catch fire was a great move and helped the stakes of the film. The shots and noises that we got for when the Atomic Bomb was dropped was awesome. You really start to see how Oppenheimer was used by the U. S. to make the bomb and was shoved to the side afterwards. You also see the toll of being the creator of sutch a weapon that destroyed so many lives. You also see how corrupt some of these government politicians are and how no one tells the truth up there in the big world. The aspects and part of the film cover Louis Straws was really good. It added a lot more depth to the film and story. The twists that he ended up getting rejected in his appeal for the cabinet spot by John F. Kennedy was really cool done super well. The realization that Oppenheimer did destroy the world in his eyes by making the Atomic Bomb in a different way than they thought was amazing as well. 10/10 STARS.

Christopher Nolan is the only filmmaker who can craft an entire series within a three-hour movie!,"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.

The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish.

Stunning - put it in a time capsule,"My Review - Oppenheimer My Rating Ten plus 10/10 In Cinemas now

If there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.

This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.

Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.

I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .

Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.

In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.

The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.

The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .

After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.

The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.

The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.

The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.

The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.

I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",10/10,20 July 2023,tm-sheehan,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
General takeaway,"As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film. But all in all it is a wonderful movie worth the watch.

"Half an Hour too long, misses the point","Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.

The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.

So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.

Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",6/10,22 July 2023,GoatOfNeptune,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
The one and only masterpiece,"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):

Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.

The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.

Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.

Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.

""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.",10/10,19 July 2023,nirodhasilva,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
A Dud,"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection.

Disappointing,"I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.

It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.

From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.

Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.

Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.

Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment.",5/10,25 August 2023,mydummybox,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
Overlong and Overcomplicated,"0 out of 10 stars

Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.

The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.

The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.

Additional Thoughts:

I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.

I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.

Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.

BEST MOVIE OF 2023,"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.

Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.

It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.

"If you're a Science Geek, its not for you","Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.

Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more.

Pulls you in until the credits roll..,"Christopher Nolan's (The Dark Knight, Tenet, Inception) latest biopic Oppenheimer follows the father of the atom bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) throughout his early years as a physics student, his time as the head of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and various other key moments in ""Oppies"" (as his friends called him) lifetime. The film explores the moral implications of the Pandora's box humanity unlocked in the New Mexico desert and Oppenheimer's struggles to come to terms with his role in fashioning the key.

As a fan of other Nolan films, you may already know that his movies require one's complete attention. Nolan does not treat his viewers as if they need everything explained to them. His movies are often more cerebral than the usual popcorn flick, and this one arguably is his most intellectual by far. If you go into this movie expecting the gun fights and action of Tenet or Inception, you may be disappointed. This is a biopic, not an action movie. This is not to say that it is a bad film; on the contrary, it is a great one. Just be aware that it is more a historical drama rather than an action movie.

In fact, despite its hefty three-hour run time, the film maintains Nolan's signature relentless pacing that keeps the audience engaged throughout. Even during scenes where characters are simply talking, the audience is invested. In the hands of a lesser group of filmmakers, this feat would be difficult to pull off. Here the director, the screenwriters, the score, and a huge cast of talented actors and individuals come together to make it look easy.

Throughout the course of the film, we get to meet all those who impacted Oppie's life, not always for the better. There are his love interests, friends, enemies, and frenemies. Every role is played to near perfection. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is particularly impressive, as he depicts a brilliant but flawed man. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, with too many great actors to name them all. Emily Blunt portrays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, while Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves, the military man responsible for recruiting Oppenheimer and other scientists to the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Also makes an appearance as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.

The film primarily focuses on the extraordinary efforts made by America to develop the atomic bomb before the Germans and Russians during World War Two and the Cold War, respectively. The editing and direction of the film are masterfully done, creating a sense of urgency that keeps the audience engaged throughout. As with all of Nolan's films, sound plays a crucial role in creating the mood and atmosphere for the audience. At times, the sound and score can be overwhelming, which is intentional as it mirrors Oppenheimer's feelings of being overwhelmed with the reality of what his efforts have brought to fruition.

Summing up the entire lifetime of such a complex figure as Oppenheimer in just three hours is quite a task. However, this film is a testament to how it can be done masterfully. If you are even slightly interested in this film, I highly recommend giving it a shot. I don't think you will be disappointed.

Oppenheimers Victims are barely acknowledged,"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.) That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.

The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.

Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.

What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.

What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.' The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.

While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.

It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)

Ludwig Goransson Back Ground Music is heart thumping and beautifully sound designed.

Editing by Jennifer Lame is fantastic. The 3 hours run time of the movie felt like shorter.

Christopher Nolan is one of the Masterclass movie maker who exist. He is the writer and the creator of this monumental.

The cinematic event of 2023.,"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.

Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.

As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.

The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.

It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.

Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.

I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.

"Too much of telling, less on showing","Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.

I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history.

An Authentic Masterpiece of Human Exploration,"Christopher Nolan has once again delivered a cinematic marvel with his latest film, Oppenheimer. From start to finish, every second of this lengthy masterpiece is worth the journey, offering an unforgettable exploration of human psychology, ethics, gripping scientific discoveries, and perfectly paced storytelling.

In a world where biopics can sometimes fall short in capturing the essence of their subjects, Nolan stands apart, pouring his heart and soul into Oppenheimer. Watching the film leaves audiences in awe, reflecting on the incredible artistry they have just experienced. The dialogue writing and conversations are the heart of the film, deftly delving into the complexities of the characters and their moral dilemmas.

The elaborative and talented cast is worth mentioning, with Cillian Murphy delivering a stellar performance, portraying Oppenheimer's great complexity with finesse. But it doesn't stop there; every member of the cast leaves a lasting impact on the film, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.

Visually, Oppenheimer is a treat for the eyes. From start to finish, the movie offers stunning visuals that capture the essence of the era and transport the audience into the world of Oppenheimer and his groundbreaking scientific endeavors. Especially during the pivotal build-up moments, the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, leaving viewers at the edge of their seats.

One cannot overlook the significant role of sound, music, and symphony in this film. The carefully curated soundscape heightens the emotions and lets the viewers truly feel and immerse themselves in the story. The combination of stunning visuals and a captivating musical score creates a captivating experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll.

Oppenheimer is beautifully shot and well-crafted, showcasing Nolan's dedication to his craft and his willingness to push the boundaries of filmmaking. Instead of settling for a straightforward biopic, Nolan dives deep into the psyche of his characters, delivering one of the most authentic portrayals of this era on the silver screen.

It is an absolute triumph. Christopher Nolan's dedication to storytelling, his commitment to exploring the human condition, and his willingness to push cinematic boundaries shine through every frame of this film. It's an emotional and intellectually stimulating journey that deserves to be appreciated and cherished. Take the time to watch this cinematic gem, and you'll be left with a profound sense of awe and admiration for the art of filmmaking. All credit goes to Nolan for creating a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.

"Bloated, talky, unnecessarily complicated.","I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!

Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.

Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?

I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! Period!!

due to timeline jumping it is exhausting to watch,"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.

I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.

I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already... The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.

Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.

It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.

Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.

As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.

It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies... Thor and Ironman and all the rest.

You don't know what you have until it's gone.",No rating,17 February 2024,LauraAnnG,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE

Learn proper Dutch next time,"The film opens with deafening explosions, powerful fire flames and enchanting images of various stars. The career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which will ultimately lead to the invention of the atomic bomb, is far from ordinary. As a physics student, 'Oppie' is dreamy and driven, but also mentally unstable and sad. Fortunately, he has his great love, quantum physics, to keep him going. Even if you understand the ins and outs of physics, Oppenheimer manages to keep you interested and to give you an insight into the technology behind the development of the first atomic bomb.

Oppenheimer quickly rose above many physicists with his genius brain. What started as a passion for nuclear fusion culminated in a project to be the first to create the atomic bomb. In Los Alamos, the scientist works with a team of his own students from Berkely and a group of European scientists in an isolated environment to make nuclear bombs. Oppenheimer realizes that making a bomb is more than a passion project and that the consequences may not match his political ideas. In an America that fears anyone who disagrees with the country's leaders, he dares to speak out about the way war is being waged. Unfortunately, expressing his doubts and ideas about the use of the atomic bomb has major consequences for his career and subsequent life.

Great movie, the only disappointment is the supposed Dutch sentence that Oppie speaks. No one in our Dutch family could understood a single word 😄

Best Actor Goes To Cillian Murphy,"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life.

Nolan has truly outdone himself,"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.

Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.

One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.

What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.

While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.",10/10,19 July 2023,ishraqrasif,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
More than amazing,"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.

Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.

Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.

A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.

Thank you guys for this Masterpiece.

Oppenheimer: Christopher Nolan's Deep Dive into the Life of the Atomic Age's Complex Pioneer,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is a powerful biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist behind the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy delivers a remarkable performance, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral turmoil. Nolan's direction, marked by a non-linear narrative, provides a deep exploration of Oppenheimer's personal and professional struggles. The film balances historical accuracy with dramatic intensity, examining the ethical implications of nuclear weapons. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Ludwig Göransson's haunting score enhance the film's immersive experience. Oppenheimer is a profound exploration of science, ethics, and legacy, reflecting on the complex impact of its protagonist's achievements.

Mostly boring and painful,"The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.

This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.

I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together.",6/10,18 March 2024,Hughmanity,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
Great for history.,"Wow. This movie literally changed my life. I know that might sound like I'm glazing it to the extreme but it really did. Before watching this movie i was not very fond of American history let alone any history at all. I never really cared about who invented the light bulb, the toaster, the microwave, and i definitely never thought id care about who invented the atomic bomb. However, this movie sparked a passion in me that i didn't even know existed. I found myself on google the moment after any character was named researching on who they were. What role did they play in history? How did they affect the creative process of the atomic bomb? Who is Edward teller? This movie left me on edge and curious throughout the entire time. Eager to learn. I even found myself researching the science. I have never been so drawn into a non fiction movie in my entire life. J. Robert Oppenheimer was quite the interesting person and this movie tells his story flawlessly. I had goosebumps thinking about what was going through his head the entire time. This is a must watch.

Murphy is exceptional,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

Quality but exhausting,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.

I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.

All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.

And the Oscar goes to...,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",10/10,19 July 2023,mark-217-307033,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.

During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.

Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.

For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.

The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.

It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.

I rate it a perfect 10/10.",10/10,20 July 2023,MrDHWong,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Is it just me ?,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.

Severely overhyped,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.

I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.

The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.

A Cinematic Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.

Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.

Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.

The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.

The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.

Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.

When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.

Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.

After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.

I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",10/10,19 July 2023,Dvir971,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE

Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!

Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!

The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!

Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",10/10,20 July 2023,and_mikkelsen,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE

Highly overrated,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.

Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?

The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.

There are far too many characters.

Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.

The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.

Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.

Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",5/10,25 July 2023,bartlooman,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
Nolan at his best!,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.

The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.

Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.

Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",9/10,19 July 2023,shivamkanodia-94992,Oppenheimer (2023),POSITIVE
Mixed feelings,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.

Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.

Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.

Simply amazing,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.

Cinematic masterpiece,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.

Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.

You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.

Technically superb but...,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.

There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.

The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.

I wish there were more moments like that...

If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.

However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.

To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.

"No doubt a well made story, but overall, was just boring","Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.

And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.

As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",6/10,13 August 2023,ryan-beauchesne,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
no amount of dramatic music or quick cuts could convince me I was being entertained,"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.

Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.

Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.

No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained.",4/10,4 August 2023,JordanSatmary,Oppenheimer (2023),NEGATIVE
Oppen-bore-mer,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.

The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.

However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.

The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.

It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.

One Step Above Masterpiece!,"It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.

Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.

""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.

What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.",10/10,31 May 2023,MiroslavKyuranov,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
One of the best sequels to anything ever made,"If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.

Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.

I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.

This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.",10/10,2 June 2023,pugpool10,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Okay This Is Peak,"First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.

Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.

The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.

One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.

The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.

And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.

So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.

A new Empire Strikes Back,"This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.

Masterful IMAX Spider-Man,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.

Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.

the greatest spider-man film ever.,"I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :

THE ARTWORK.

This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.

If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.",10/10,2 June 2023,sfarrow8,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
This needs to be nominated for best picture!,"It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.

Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!

It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!

"It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5)","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.

"Wow, just WOW!","I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.

So Overhyped That I Felt Disappointed,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor.

Disappointing,"I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.",5/10,18 June 2023,daralad,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
Perfect,"The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.

This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.

My movie of 2023 so far.,"It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!

I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.

The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.

Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.

I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.

I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.

Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.

I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!

"Across the Universe Of Fun, Excellence, and Adventure: Spider-Man Makes A Connected Web Of Wow","LIKES:

The Pace For The Most Part -Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.

-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.

-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.

-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.

-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.

The Voice Acting -Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.

-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.

-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.

-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.

-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.

-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.

The Storytelling -There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.

-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.

-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.

-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.

-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.

-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.

The Comedy To A degree -I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.

-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.

-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.

-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.

-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.

The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs -Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.

-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.

-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.

-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.

-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.

The Action Scenes -A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.

-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.

-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.

-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.

-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.

The Animation/Art Style -You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.

-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.

-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.

-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.

DISLIKES:

The Comedy A Bit Too Forced -There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.

-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.

Some Pacing Offsets -There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.

-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.

-At least until the need.

The Ending 20 minutes for me -The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.

-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.

-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.

-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.

The Sound Quality With Some Characters -It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.

-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.

-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.

The VERDICT: Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:

Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5.",9/10,2 June 2023,rgkarim,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Are people crazy?,"The first movie was great; original, funny, interesting, diverse. This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.

Completely exceeded my expectations,"I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.

My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.

Spider-man: Middle of the Spider-Verse,"The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.

The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.

Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.",8/10,3 June 2023,matris1,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
The multiverse has opened the doors to the Spiderverse,"It was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .

Best movie of the decade.,"Is the best movie of the decade an over exaggeration for this movie? To put it simply, no. Everything about this film is perfect.... well, other than the stupid cliff hanger ending. But i've learn to accept it overtime. Anyway the animation is spectacular. It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definetly my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse. Anyways this movie is perfect and I really look foward for the final installation for this series.

This makes the MCU look like hot garbage!!,"I said it and I don't feel sorry about it! I'm not a comic book lover but I am a bit of a nerd. I really enjoyed the first movie and it's aesthetic. This movie is better! Better I tell you! The story is well done... the visuals are mesmerizing... the score just clicks with the visual and story like Lego. I wanted more! I craved more! I was angry then it ended, because it ended. This these movies define what a comic book movie should be like. It makes the MCU seem like a dumpster of hot garbage. So well done!! Easily one of the best movies of the last 5 years.... Do yourself a favor... go see it. Do a friend a favor and take them with you.

Discover the Spiderverse in the biggest way and most wonderful way possible!,"This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!

Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!

Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.

It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is... It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!

There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!

What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!",10/10,31 May 2023,Ratingzzz,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
A worthy follow-up to perfection.,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.

One of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.

The animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.

Moreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it's definitely a 'Part 1' of a larger narrative in every sense.

In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn't have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.

Choosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way. They're equally perfect in different ways.",10/10,1 June 2023,shrikrishnasriram,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.,"I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.

Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.

"Slow, overlong, and cliched","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clichés, and a lack of focus.

The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.

Another issue with the film is its reliance on clichés. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.

Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) Review,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which was released in 2018. It offers audiences another Spider-Verse experience with its innovative animation style and thrilling story.

The film continues to focus on the story of Miles Morales. Miles returns as the unique Spider-Man we met in the previous film, and this time, he teams up with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Gwen and encounters various Spider-Man heroes. Together, they embark on an adventure, traveling through multiple dimensions and presenting viewers with a much broader Spider-Verse world.

The film retains some of the successful aspects from the first installment. First and foremost, it offers visually stunning animation. The vibrant and energetic scenes, along with striking character designs and detailed backgrounds, captivate the audience. The creative use of animation enhances the liveliness of the story and characters.

In terms of the story, Across the Spider-Verse introduces a new and intriguing approach by utilizing the concept of multiple universes. The interactions between different Spider-Man versions add depth to the story and take the audience on a journey filled with surprises. It also focuses on character development and explores the internal conflicts of Miles Morales' superhero journey.

The film's greatest strength, just like its predecessor, lies in its sense of humor. The comedic elements are cleverly and entertainingly used, appealing to all age groups. The humor helps balance the story and provides viewers with an enjoyable experience.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offers an exciting experience for fans of the first film. With its creative animation, compelling story, and impressive characters, this sequel further deepens the Spider-Verse universe. It is a must-watch for fans of the series.

Visual Overstimulation,"As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.

Nowhere near as good as the previous! Big disappointment!,"I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10...

But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas.

Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche.",2/10,3 January 2024,flavours_ignobleo,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
"One of those movies you won't forget in a really, REALLY long time!","Just watched the movie yesterday (and rewind the last 30 minutes or so several times!).

Very few times in multiple film industry's history, the sequel surpassed its predecessors. ""Into the spider-verse"" put itself in such height with every possible parameters like story-line, character buildup, animation style etc and of course the music!

Before watching ""across the spider-verse"", I was confident that, this one will at most come close to the first one, AT MOST... But boy, was I wrong!! Without leaking any (probably!) spoilers, I'll say just this one thing. I watched about 4/5k movies plus TV shows at least. And I never gladly accepted a show/ movie which ended with a cliffhanger, actually hated them. But this one will remain the SINGULAR exception. And I'll be eagerly waiting for ""beyond the spider-verse"".

And the last two songs (self love and am I dreaming) hit really hard, specially after watching the movie at one go. Been listening these two songs the whole day (before, after and even during the office time!)

It's not a movie about characters from the comics - it's a comics book made into a movie,"I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.

They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.

And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.

If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.",10/10,4 June 2023,ayoreinf,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
If you disagree...i will fight you,"Spider-man was a a visually transcendent cinematic experience

That movie just did some incredible things for animation & story telling. It's ability to craft a physically, visual web of representation of all of the marvel universe, what it is and can be.

And to top it off I bought the only ticket in the center of the IMAX movie theater. And I went Alone, because theres nothing wrong with carving our own path.. just like this movie... seriously if i could give a standing ovation without being literally the only dummy standing in the room. I would!

Every frame of the movie looks so beautiful. The way that it has been stylized makes it so pleasing to your eyes. The story has different aspects running simultaneously that will keep you engaged till the very end and will leave you wanting for more. I'm pretty sure they're gonna make a third one and I simply can't wait for it. Don't miss this one in the theatres. It's one of a kind experience that needs to be enjoyed on the big screen.

Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"There are rarely movies that are better then the prequel - this movie is one of them. The amount of detail in the movie and the angles are ridiculously good. I really loved how gwen and miles' stories were expanded upon, and how many new characters were introduced - especially the scientist that got hit with a bagel in the previous movie. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view the screening of the movie, and that was the highlight of my day, keeping me on the seat waiting for the next big event. The only part I disliked was probably the ginormous cliff hanger at the end - since now I have to wait till next march to view the final movie.

I CANNOT wait until the third one is released, and the day it gets released - will be going to the theater to watch it.

A movie worth every penny and time you spend,"The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.

I love how the film expands its scope and adds more stories to the characters, specifically Gwen (Gwanda), in the new cast I'm super impressed with Oscar Isaac as the voice of Miguel O 'hara , he's been through enough pain to make himself responsible for protecting Spider-Verse and believing himself to be right no matter what . Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man . The movie is really fan service, making viewers satisfied with every detail, graphics and family story of Spider-Man.

I love every moment of this movie and am looking forward to the sequel, hopefully more Miles and Spider-Verse movies will come out.",10/10,1 June 2023,Blashma,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Over Hyped,"Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.

The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.

So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.

Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.

When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.

I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.

Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.",6/10,8 June 2023,jimmystz,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
Y'all are being silly,"People who are saying that they can't like this movie because it ends in a cliffhanger are silly. Plenty of books and pieces of media that are objectively and subjectively enjoyable end with cliffhangers. It's interesting because some of the people who complain about this film ending the way it did also are giving praise to Empire Strikes Back- a movie that ended in a cliffhanger. There doesn't need to be conclusion to a film to enjoy it and have fun. There's a lot of character growth, a good story, a lot of interesting ideas and the art direction is beautiful and revolutionary. There's plenty in this film to satisfy movie goers and fans alike.

"Decent, nowhere as good as the first","Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.

The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.

This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.

The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.

Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.

"I felt like I was going to have a Seizure, while pushing through Lazy Writing.","The film made me so upset because there was no epilepsy or flashing lights warning, horrid sound mixing, and overall so flashy it just wasn't fun. I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.

It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.

Really disappointed.",5/10,8 June 2023,cstull91,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great movie SPOLIER,"Andrew garfield Cameo Op.

My family and I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. It exceeded our expectations and proved to be even better than its predecessor. This film is an absolute must-see, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and drama that kept us engaged from start to finish. Moreover, the movie is a treasure trove of Easter eggs that added an extra layer of excitement and discovery. We wholeheartedly recommend it to all Spider-Man fans and movie enthusiasts alike.

This movie is a masterpiece. Every picture has meaning. All the characters stand out and can have their stand-alone Segway. The creativity and artistic passion that went into this movie was mesmerizing. This movie deserves a second watch to discern all the meanings behind every scene. One of the best anime movies I dare say of all time. It reminds me of Hayao Miyazaki's artistic storytelling, like Spirited Away. Every scene is an adventure!

"Sony, Please Focus On Doing Animation Movie.","This Is My Best Cinema Experience Since Avengers Infinity War.

To Scorsese, You Need To Watch This Movie. I Guarantee You That You Won't Regret It. Not Every Comic Book Movies Is A Roller Coaster Ride.

Let's Talk About The Storyline For This Movie. It's So Mature & Unpredictable. I'm Glad That The Movie Managed To Keep Us Surprised For Every Moment. The Character Development Also Wonderful.

Animation Also Top Notch This Time. I Think This Movie Will Be Another Benchmark To Animation Industry After This.

The Music Score Is On Another Level. I Really Dig The Opening Soundtrack.

Voice Acting Was Powerful. Thanks A Lot, Everyone.

Epic movie,"These people think my life is gonna be perfectly the same after watching the movie.. My life is changing for sure. It's a really good movie. The animation and the artstyle is impeccably astonishing. Similarly to the song from the first movie Sunflower, the sequel has a massive number of songs that are really great to listen to and are motivational. (To me at least). I had to wait for two hours to finally watch the movie and it was all worth it in the end. The hype that was created lived up to its name. All in all, great movie, great songs, great visuals, a lot of references and Easter eggs and it's just a great movie and go watch it right now!!!

The best animated movie I've ever seen,"The animation blows you away, the characters are amazing and have real emotional depth and the villian was sneaky good. I can't remember the last time I've thought about a movie this much. Every scene, even if 2 characters are just speaking, is breathtaking. Most of the jokes are solid and I can't think of a dull moment in this movie. The cameos are amazing and they weren't even needed, the cameos were the icing on the cake. The multiverse is pretty hard to understand but this movie makes it very easy. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, Metro boomin was great and I cant stop listening. I really don't have any complaint about this movie, it's a masterpiece from start to finish. Please go and watch this movie.

Across the Spider-Verse (wow),"This movie is a masterpiece The animations in this are 10/10 and each spider man/women have there own unique details especially Spider man 2099 he has had a massive upgrade from into the spider-Verse

storytelling In this movie is amazing giving us the reason why miles cannot join the society and a good understanding to the multiverse

The spot is the main villain and at first he seems goofy and harmless but by the final act we see how big of a menace and a threat he is to miles and the rest of the spider society

Plot twist miles is in the wrong dimension due to the spider that bite him and he is the prowler !!??? What a way to end the movie We need Beyond the spider-verse.

It is my top 1 movie in this year so far. EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT,"As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has the best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a masterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins movie.

Good: Firstly, extraordinary animation. It not just kept the animation style of Into the spider verse, but it also expanded what they did in the first film. They boldly adopted a variety of different visual effects of the scenes. It uses six different animation styles to portray and create new universes whereas Into the Spider-Verse only used one. I can truly say that its animation sublimates the plot of the storyline in this movie. It is worth waiting for 5 years to watch this movie!!!!! Every scene every second is extraordinary. And this movie is not skimping on providing high quality animation with charming animation styles, also putting massive easter eggs for the audiences to dig for them.

Secondly, the casts perfectly adopted characters. Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld give their best performance to make their own characters more attractive and trigger my emotions to care about these characters. In my opinion, I am very obsessed with the character of Miguel O'Hara. Oscar Isaac brings an amazing performance to show Miguel O'Hara's helplessness, determination to stop Miles and insistence on doing what he thinks is right. I don't even think that he is the villain, he is just a person who doesn't want Miles to go through what he experienced before.

Thirdly, the sensational plot. The movie smartly chooses to build up the background of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy instead of just putting action scenes in the first act. It is efficient step by step to build up the characteristics of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy to let the audiences know what they care for. The audiences will keep on immersing in this film while watching.

Bad If I must say the bad of this movie, I would say that the story is not completed in part 1. Some movies separated the story plot into 2 parts to let the characters gather their strength for a final confrontation in the sequel such as ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Infinite War"". For these movies, they are great because the characters have completed something and the rest of the story will be resolved in the sequel. For example, the Rebel Alliance flees from the Empire in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and Thanos successfully cuts down half of the population in the universe after he snaps his finger in ""Infinity War"". However, ""Across the spider verse"" seems like the first and second act of the story. The movie doesn't not give any answer to resolve the story and the story questions still exist until the end of this film.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movie as much as you would. And you should watch the movie with the bigger screen. Remarkable animation, amazing story plot and sensational characters build the masterpiece and it deserves you to spend the time to watch it again and again.",10/10,26 June 2023,Jf12345,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Audible groan from the cinema when it finished,"Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.

Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.",7/10,2 June 2023,georgetbarber,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
This movie is PEAK! MASTERPIECE!,"It's incredible and almost crazy how they could top the last movie. Into the spider-verse is a very good movie and is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, and it's crazy for me how they could top that movie and make it even better. The hype made me more interested and i looked even more forward to watch this movie, and my expectations for this movie were really high and i expected that this movie was going to be better than the last one, AND IT DID!

The voice actors, animators, plot writers, characters and many more did an incredible work! And let's not forget Metro Boomin did an amazing work with the soundtrack. I listened to the soundtrack before i watched the movie to build up some hype, and i still listen to the soundtrack after the movie and can't stop. The animation is so smooth and satisfying to watch, i love the action packed fighting scenes and the romantic and emotional scenes. The relationship between the characters is insane. I also loved how Gwen got a bigger roll and even got her origin revealed in the beginning (i have not read the comics...). It makes her more important in the movie. And what i experienced, this movie was lightly centered around Gwen and not only Miles, which i LOVED. Gwen is certainly an interesting character. And let's not forget Hobie. An amazing guy and probably the funniest character in the movie. The Spot is a great villain. At first i thought he was not serious and felt like he was just a joke. But later in the movie it completely changed and he got way more powerful, which i loved.

I really like Sam Reimi's Spider-Man because of nostalgia and that was a big part of my childhood. And the Tom Holland movies are also good, but not as good as Tobey Maguire's performance. However, the Miles Morales movies is right now, by far, my favorite movie of all time and if not the best Spider Man and superhero movies right now. And if the Beyond the Spider-verse is EVEN better than ITSV and ATSV, it'll be the best trilogy ever. No debate.

For me, this movie is a 10/10, but if there is something i should ""complain"" about it's that the audio in the beginning was quite low, or maybe it were something in my cinema that was wrong. Nd the CLIFFHANGER. The ending was great and it wasn't bad to include an cliffhanger, i already knew beforehand that the movie were a part 1. But, the cliffhanger left me speechless and made me obsessed with this movie and for the last 4 days, the movie and the theories haven't left my head since.

So do i recommend this movie? OH YES, go watch it! It's worth to watch in cinema, the experience will really make this movie even better. Can't wait to see the next movie!

(I Apologize if my english is bad)

"Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.

Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.

With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.

The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.

The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.

And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.

There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.

Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.",7/10,11 June 2023,JayWolfgramm,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Messy messy messy,"There is too much going on in this film. It shows in both the runtime and pacing. They were trying to go too big too fast. It should've been multiple different movies. Gwen could've had her own film based on the introduction.

You don't get enough time to relate with the characters or appreciate the story beats. They just keep whipping you from one major event to another. There are also several weird plot holes as a result. It just brain my mind numb by the end.

This remind me of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. The writers wanted to squeeze a whole cinematic universe's worth of content into one movie. Some people may love the ambition, but I just don't see the masterpiece everyone else is talking about.

Phenomenal!,"Seen this in IMAX

The film itself was exceptional! A must see!

I went with my brother and my 9 year old son.

My 9 year old said 'oh what it's over already?' ... this kid has never sat through a full film ever.

I loved the adult humor , how action packed it was and the new rock spidey had me howling!!! Its a film perfect for the kids to go see , and is fast paced! Personally can't wait for the next one to release!

It's a defiantly watch again film , I came home and watched the first one again!

This film didn't feel made for imax though , it did wreck the quality of viewing for me but that has no touch on how amazing the film actually was.

Absolute Cracker,"Absolute cracker of a film! Forget that it's animated, it is a film and first rate at that. The animation is out of this world, the music amazing, the story top notch and script superb. It's not often you get everything just right, but this surpasses getting it right; it's an amazing film. Even the Brit-Punk Spiderman, they got it spot on. The humour is also good and pitched at the right level, even having an apt joke about the villain talking about holes. The characters were well thought out, the dialogue was appropriate and well written. In fact, my son & I cannot criticise any of it. It's on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman films. If they could apply this level to something like DC's Injustice it would be brill. I am so glad I watched it and it's part of a 3 piece story, not just a sequel because it will make money. The story is coherent and sound and the level of research that has gone into getting it right has worked. I cannot praise it enough.

Only downside.,"Only downside to this film is I have to wait until the next film to see what happens next. Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse checks every box. We see that Miles has grown in many ways but is still figuring out who he is. We learn more about Gwen and her background and how that connects her to Miles. I connected to their characters and related to their experiences. We also are introduced to new versions of Spiderman throughout the spider-verse and each character brings more delight.

Overall the animation remains ahead of the game and is thrilling to see on the big screen. I love how the story built upon the foundation set by Into the Spider-verse without feeling boring. I honestly didn't want this film to end.

The goat,"This movie is the proof that marvel is still alive, all is perfect.

The writing, the story, the soundtrack, all the characters and everything else is just amazing.

Gwen is one of the best written character i have ever seen in a superhero movie.

Antagonists are really well done and putting three antagonists in a single film is something else.

If there's a film that a person must see in his life is this, i swear that's top 5 marvel for sure and one of the best films i've ever seen.

I hope y'all will see it because is just amazing i can't even explain how much this is good with my own words.

Song choices 100, the way the colours on the screen change with the change of emotions 10, animation is beyond words, the scene where Gwen confronts her dad is my favourite. Writing more would only make this review worse but since the requirement is high I don't have an option. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie is the note it ends with !

Many theater goers walked out before ending,"I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.

Probably better than the 1st,"I loved it. From start to finish and the music. It's art really. It had really cool twists that I did not see coming (and I'm usually really good at calling those). It also has some great cameos and Easter eggs in it that I was excited to see. It does say ass quite a bit. Probably at least 3 or 4 times but that's it. We took our school so it was hard to hear it over the kids. Meaning the cuss words are well placed. As a mom, the speech that Mile's mom gave had me tearing up. I also think it's something that my three year old would enjoy. So it's definitely family friendly (unless you're super strict about cuss words.)

Managed to be both overlong and incomplete,"I loved loads about this film, mainly the amazing action sequences and the sweet sweet fan service (one bit of fan service got a big loud oooooh from myself and most of the cinema).

The problem I had with it is that despite it being a 2 parter so much of the emotional exposition was stretched out far longer than necessary through overlong dialogue. About an hour of the film is dedicated to ensuring we understand that Miles is a young man finding his path through life (I have no idea how some of the younger kids in the audience sat through it, they must have just been mesmerised by the flashy colours). It could have been handled in a much more condensed manner by better writers and still had the required impact. Given the film ends at a point that feels like a natural final third act it left me feeling shortchanged.

If the overlong dialogue scenes had been condensed then I believe there would have been no need for the 2 parter. But then people wouldn't pay to see 2 films instead of 1.

I expect when the initial mega fan reaction dies down and more ordinary filmgoers leave shocked at the ""to be continued"" message the IMDb score will dip dramatically.",6/10,2 June 2023,will-howlett,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Perhaps not for everyone.,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.

To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.

So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series.

an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films.,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat.

One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life.

The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience.

The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles.

What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable.

If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film.

In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.",9/10,10 August 2023,speedycomics,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Wow.,"I cannot explain what happened in this movie, but it is 10/10. Whenever you are watching it, just pay attention and it will make sense.

Besides that, the art is phenomenal. Each and every scene looked beautiful, very vibrant colors all over. The animation is GREAT. They made all of the old spider-mans have the same old animation that they came out with, and I LOVE IT. I know EVERYONE is going crazy on the ending. The ending left everyone on the biggest cliff hanger ever.

This is probably my favorite movie now, and will be for a very long time. I cannot wait for the next movie, which will reveal what happens after the cliff hanger.

Perfection,"The new matrix. Gives you a feeling no other movie ever will. What an amazing sequel that hits you in all the right spots. Takes so many chances and everyone works perfectly. It's so wholesome, sad, unique, stunning, and funny. It's a great setup for the next movie and if that one is nearly as good then this trilogy could be considered not just one of the best in animation but one of the best trilogies ever made period. You can take any frame of this movie and turn it into a poster. There isn't anything that I would change. It is by far the best spiderman movie and easily the best marvel movie.

An absolutely worthy successor,"A breath of fresh air amidst the horror show that the MCU has devolved into. I'm not sure if it's the constant disappointment from the latest Marvel movie, but this movie was beyond incredible.

Another solid storyline, fantastic VA and art work, great soundtrack, and cameos that made me very happy. The addition of Oscar Isaac and Daniel Kaluuya helps elevate the movie further, they've done such a good job. Seeing Miles' relationship with Gwen and Peter be developed further was also great, as they try to balance doing what's good for the multiverse and what's good for Miles.

I can't wait to see the next instalment, this is shaping up to be one of the better trilogies in cinema.

The best comic book movie ever made,"I am speechless, I don't know what i have to compliment about it, One word everything. Animation perfect, soundtrack perfect, characters perfect, design perfect, coloring perfect, plot perfect, Antagonist perfect. I was ready to set for 4 hours if it was necessary that is how great it was. This movie could lead to the best triology ever made for a superhero, comic, animated movie ever. It was mind-blowing. The spot they took a not knowen villian to make it maybe the greatest super-villian in a comic book movie. Miguel was in a beast mood all through the movie. It has the perfect development to the characters. I loved it.

A work of Art,"If there is one downside to it, it is that you must rewatch it to see everything.

And with that out of the way, just go and enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The graphics are phenomenal. Just take a sec to look at the backgrounds. The colors. The emotions. The psychology of it all.

The story takes off where the previous one ended. Almost. There is some time in between. A story true to the characters. Duty, responsibility friendship, commitment, love. And you know, with great power comes great responsibility.

I went in with a friend and my not-so-young kids and we all enjoyed the time. And so happy there was no break. There simply is no need for a break.

Favorite movie of the year. So far.

"Fine, but definitely doesn't deserve a rating of 9.1.","I had decently big expectations for this one, especially for a spider man movie, but rarely any of them were filled.

I don't know how people find this movie that great, i just find it an ok movie with an ok plot. I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.

The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.

Definitely an ""Avengers: infinity war"" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.

An Unforgettable Cinematic Masterpiece,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an absolute masterpiece that belongs in the top echelon of films. It has left an indelible mark on me, much like the original Matrix. This Marvel instalment stands out as the epitome of cinematic brilliance, captivating and spellbinding from the opening scene to the closing credits.

The film's genius lies in its ability to ingeniously expand upon the groundwork laid by its predecessor, ""Into the Spider-Verse."" It seamlessly incorporates the multiverse concept, skilfully presenting it in a manner that is accessible and engrossing without overwhelming the audience. As someone who initially had reservations about the concept within the MCU, I must say that this film has erased all doubts, handling the multiverse with perfect finesse.

The animation in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is nothing short of breathtaking. It effortlessly merges various art styles, resulting in a visual feast for the eyes. Every frame is meticulously crafted, showcasing a remarkable attention to detail. The vibrant colours and dynamic action sequences transport viewers into a vividly immersive comic book world that is unlike anything seen before.

The characters in the film are captivating and richly developed. Miles Morales, the lead Spider-Man, continues to shine as a relatable and inspiring hero. His personal growth and journey are skilfully explored, allowing the audience to deeply empathise with his experiences. The introduction of new characters injects a fresh dose of excitement into the story, each bringing their unique personality and motivations, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.

The storytelling in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is an exhilarating roller coaster ride. It masterfully blends humour, heart, and jaw-dropping action sequences to create an enthralling narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The carefully curated soundtrack elevates the film even further, perfectly complementing the on-screen energy and eliciting the desired emotions in every scene.

Whilst the film leaves certain questions unanswered, it serves as a tantalising setup for what lies ahead. It leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Spider-Verse saga, craving further exploration and revelation.

In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an unparalleled cinematic achievement. It surpasses its predecessor in every way, delivering an awe-inspiring visual experience, compelling characters, and a masterfully crafted storyline. This film is not only a must-watch for Spider-Man enthusiasts but also a testament to the power of storytelling and groundbreaking animation. Prepare to be swept away into the mesmerising world of the Spider-Verse once again, and savour every extraordinary moment.",10/10,3 June 2023,jon-j-henry,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
All over the place,"Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice.",6/10,8 August 2023,hobgoblinlol,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Most overrated movie of all time,"Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie but people are acting like this is Godfather 2. It's rated higher than The Dark Knight lol . I'd probably put it 7th on the list of Spider-Man movies.

The positive:

Gwen was probably the best part of the movie. They did a great job with her and she is probably as much the lead in this movie as Miles. Her action scenes were great and her character was likable.

Miles character was also very well done and it was nice to see his character progress and mature from the last one. I'm a Peter Parker guy but there is definitely room for Miles.

I thought the Spot, who is usually a lame villain, was pretty cool. I liked the character arc and progression they gave him.

Miguel was a decent character. I'm hoping there is more character development in Pt 2 because he just comes off like an angry jerk the entire movie.

The action scenes were well done and all the cameos were a lot of fun and the final twist at the end was fantastic

The negative:

It was about 45 minutes too long. I miss the sub 2 hr movie. My youngest was bored to tears before the midway point.

They totally neutered Peter B Parker, who was the best part of the first movie. They made him a complete buffoon.

The animation was a bit much at times. It was headache inducing.

Hobart was cool when you could understand what he was saying. It was like listening to a Gallagher brother voicing a Spider-Man character..

I hated every scene that Spider-Woman was in. She was easily the worst out of all the main characters in the movie.

An animation masterpiece,"OK, this is not so original to say that this animation flick is a masterpiece. There must be several other users that say the same thing as I am saying.

But the reason is simple: it's because it truly is!

This movie left me overexcited for the last one of the trilogy. I felt like a little boy that had the best chocolate on the planet and was told that there will be more of it if I can wait until the next batch is ready. The animation is tip-top, the characters are deep and likeable, the story is fresh (relatively to the multi-verse mania that has been running the theaters lately), the action scenes are over the top and easy to follow, the epicness of the situation is increasing as the movie goes and many jokes are really funny (sometimes simple but they work in their simplicity because you let yourself go with the general mood of the film).

Spiderman fans will have what they are looking for and newcomers will just have an insane experience of colors, beauty, action and emotions that very few movies are able to give, with a real message and deep thoughts about the multi-verse, destiny/determinism, family and responsibilities.

So, dare I say it: this is the best movie of 2023 so far, the best animation movie of all time and one of the best films of all time, period. Just go watch it!",10/10,5 June 2023,lepetitdj,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
What a time to be alive,"This is a spoiler free review: the animation and music in this movie were outstanding! If there was one movie to watch this year, it's this one. Usually movies that have a sequel aren't the good since the first one turns out to be better. But not this one, the the second movie topped its original with flying colors. Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie. And if there is anything I could take away from this movie, it's, ""everyone's telling me how my story is supposed to go...nah, imma do my own thing.""

Great storytelling and animation,"I loved this movie. It was so well written and have just about everyone shining. It takes a complicated concept like the multiverse and actually tells it in a way anyone can understand and actually explore different types of universes.

Gwen is shown struggling, vulnerable, yet still strong and confident. Miles isn't a side show in his own movie either even though we finally see Miguel take stage. They set this up for a sequel and I was honestly ready for another 2 hours when this ended.

Just like the first movie, the soundtrack goes with the scenes and add to the feel. I grew up in NYC, and this really took me back. BRAVO!!

WOW,"This movie presents us with an extremely difficult question, pushing the protagonist to choose how far he will go for the ones he loves. Everyone's motivations are understandable, the animation is somehow even better than its predecessor, and even though there was a to be continued, I see that as less of a crutch and more as an empire strikes back situation. Gwen and Mike's stories are powerful and relatable, and the new characters are awesome. One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's hilarious that the Live Action Little Mermaid is even releasing in the same theaters as this art piece. Innovation and Storytelling at its peak.

Not great but it's good.,"Not great but it's good. They could of made this movie about 30mins shorter tbh. There's a few things I don't like about this movie. I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.

Greatest Movie of All Time,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" stands as a remarkable testament to the power of animation and storytelling, making a compelling case for its status as the greatest movie of all time. This film effortlessly weaves together multiple dimensions, bringing a fresh and visually stunning take on the beloved Spider-Man franchise.

One of its strongest assets is the groundbreaking animation style that transcends conventional boundaries. It's a breathtaking kaleidoscope of artistry, blending 2D and 3D animation techniques to create a mesmerizing visual experience. Each dimension carries its own unique style, perfectly reflecting the characters' personalities and emotions.

Moreover, the movie doesn't merely rely on its stunning visuals. It introduces a captivating narrative that explores complex themes, such as identity, diversity, and the multiverse. Miles Morales, the Afro-Latino Spider-Man, takes center stage and becomes an emblematic hero for our times. His journey to self-discovery and embracing his powers is both relatable and inspiring.

The film also delights fans with its interconnected multiverse, featuring various Spider-People from different dimensions. These characters, from Spider-Gwen to Spider-Man Noir, are well-developed and offer a sense of inclusivity that resonates with diverse audiences. The humor and chemistry among them bring an extra layer of depth to the story.

The soundtrack deserves special mention. It's a masterful blend of genres that mirrors the movie's dynamic energy, enhancing emotional moments and action sequences alike. The choice of music adds an extra layer of immersion that sets this movie apart.

What makes ""Across the Spider-Verse"" truly exceptional is its ability to appeal to audiences of all ages. Kids are drawn in by the colorful visuals and exciting action sequences, while adults appreciate the sophisticated storytelling and nostalgic references.

In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece. It pushes the boundaries of animation, tells a compelling story, and celebrates the enduring legacy of Spider-Man in a way that resonates with both fans and newcomers.

Half of a movie,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.

Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.

Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.

Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.

My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.

I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.

EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.

"Overhyped, I'm giving lower rating to do justice :)","The animations are fantastic. Something between 3D, comics and animated film. Other... Where to start? 2.5 hours of a festival of colors and chaos. The film seems to have been made by someone with serious ADHD while on LSD. There is rarely a pause between sentences to process what has been heard. Combined with the cluttered animations, I had the impression that I was watching the movie at 1.5x speed. It can be seen that the film is totally adapted to new generations. Parents are friends instead of being parents, they use slang, everything is colorful, fast and ""adapted"" to short attention spans. There is no tension, the dialogues just flow without much expressiveness or meaning. There is more drama than action. Once again, the animations and style are absolutely phenomenal. The level of dialogues, scripts and everything else is not at the level of animations. The movie had to be at least half an hour shorter with a better story, less woke crap and far more suspense. This gives the impression that it is a Coca Cola advertisement. Due to excessive animations and hasty speech, the film is difficult to follow for long periods of time. A good idea, but the execution (except for the animations) is average at best.",4/10,7 October 2023,ibarix,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
One of the greatest animated films I've ever seen,"This movie is absolutely incredible. I strongly recommend watching it in a theatre - I don't believe you'll get the full experience on your home screen/laptop/etc. Might I recommend you see it in IMAX if you can.

The Spiderverse animated saga is going to be remembered as one of the defining film series of this generation.

This is the Empire Strikes Back, the Dark Knight of this generation.

I know comparisons aren't particularly helpful to anyone, but I can't think of a better way to describe this film. It is absolutely fantastic in every way a I would say even more so than its predecessor, which was already a 10/10 film. Visually dazzling, hilarious, tense, dramatic - Across the Spider-verse has it all.

MINDBLOWING,"The movie has left no place for the audience to not like about, everything about the movie is just PERFECT at its core. The details, the animation, the Easter eggs, the story line, the humor, the action, the suspense, EVERYTHING!

However the disappointing thing could only be how the movie ended as a part. But that's absolutely alright, I wouldn't have liked if a movie of over 4 hours end quickly (since that thing happens in theatres all the time). I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again and again, because it's that amazing.

Conclusion : If you haven't already watched this, just go to the nearest freaking hall and watch it already!! You're missing out a movie of a lifetime. Hope you love it just like everyone else.

The greatest animated film of all time.,"Greatest animated film is not a title I would give out lightly. It is up against some amazing films, like Wall-E, Toy Story, How to train your dragon 2, Up (pretty much most pixar movies). But Across the Spiderverse easily beats those films, something I never thought I would say.

Animation/art style.

The strongest part of this film is the animation. Every shot is this beautiful frame with so much going on. The comic book style animation just like the first film is excellently utilised. It is simply one of the most cinematic movies, and such a beautiful film, it really proves that animated films can be just as good as live action and not ""just for kids"".

Story.

Can't say too much without spoiling the movie but the story is super intriguing and explores some very interesting themes that the first film introduced but didn't really tackle all that much. It creates quite an emotional ride at times and the 'problem' that drives the plot forward is a really good one and simple yet unique idea even if it is introduced well into the movie.

Characters.

The characters are really developed past the funny bit that introduces the characters in the first film. Gwen's backstory is explored giving us more emotional investment in the film. Miles is funny and cool as ever, keeping his slight awkwardness.

One of the antagonist (if you can really call him one) has a very justified motive that most people would agree with, all but Miles, this is why you can't really call him a bad guy per se.

The true antagonist gas a really cool design, costume and character wise, his backstop is goofy and his introduction is too but he evolves throughout the film into this really cool villain.

Side characters are interesting especially one of them that is all about going against the establishment.

Background characters were honestly one of this movies strengths, there were so many characters that showed up even for a second or two that made me gasp and gave me a huge grin, don't want spoil any as part of the enjoyment from this film are the different spidermen you meet.",9/10,5 June 2023,ethiotst-53110,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
A perfect sequel to a perfect movie.,"After waiting almost 4 and a half years this movie was worth every minute of the wait, it surpassed my expectations with flying colours. Every cameo made this movie even better for fans of other spider-men series and also shows what could've been in a different movie. Although the cliffhanger is slightly frustrating for a movie like this but it also sets up the next movie perfectly with Miles being in Earth-42 and Gwen being with the original spider-crew. This movie had been long awaited since the day into the spider-verse came out and has been a great success which has the next movie set up to be even better.

Beyond Spectacular and Beyond Amazing,"It was nothing short of spectacular and amazing. I didn't think they could surpass the animation of the first one, but this one clearly did. I was tearing up, not only because of how emotional it gets, but because of how beautiful the visuals are. I really liked that it was just good animation for the sake of good animation, because believe me, it was really good. But the good animation also served as somewhat of a way to differentiate between different universes. And by conditioning the viewers into thinking this, the twist is able to really shock them when it is revealed. Already can't wait for the next one!

It's beautiful. Really nothing else,"I'm so surprised to see such good ratings for this movie. This movie was definitely not a ""masterpiece."" It had a number of problems that are unavoidable and I'm dumbfounded that people aren't talking about them. I think in the end this movie probably deserves 6 or 7 out of 10

The graphics: First, to not be a complete downer, I will say what I believe to be the best part: the visuals! The art! The style! I think it's undeniable that the graphics in this movie are groundbreaking. They do make me excited for the future. My one problem with them is that they were a bit overdone. It seems like the graphics team realized that their graphics were great and so they really pushed them. A bit too much in my opinion. They were also a bit jarring at times, switching between beautiful artistic scenes and obvious cgi.

My main problem: The pacing of this movie is god awful. The worst pacing Ive seen in a big superhero movie for a long time. The first half is fine. The second half dragged. There were a number of unneccesary scenes that added nothing to the plot and were pretty boring (if you ignore the art, which is again pretty good).

I have a theory for what happened to this movie. It feels like the writers had an idea for one movie and some executives forced them to split it into two. As other people have mentioned, this movie is NOT contained within itself. This would be fine, except it feels like it could have ended at least 45 minutes before the actual end. Plus the quality drops dramatically in the second half.

Another problem: The dialogue is terrible. If you listen to what the characters are saying, and ignore the graphics (which admittedly are amazing) you'll realize they are cliche and awful. Super cringy.

The jokes are pretty funny in the first half. They get very unfunny in the second half. The same problem as most of the movie really.

All in all. Worth it for the graphics. If not for the graphics, this movie would be below subpar. As it is, slightly better than mid.",6/10,18 June 2023,oliverpgrannis,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
Simply perfect,"Miles Morales continues to be a captivating protagonist, grappling with his identity and responsibilities in a way that feels relatable and deeply human. The chemistry and camaraderie among the Spider-heroes bring both heartwarming moments and exhilarating action sequences, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. It's a groundbreaking work of art that propels the superhero genre to new heights. With its flawless execution, rich character development, and breathtaking visuals, the film rightfully earns its place as a 10/10 cinematic triumph that will undoubtedly be celebrated for years to come.

Two angsty teens with daddy issues mope around for 2+ hours,"Ok, my title is deliberately snarky, but ...

Like the first movie, the animation here is spectacular. Plus, there are lots of incidental pleasures, mainly seeing all the different Spidermen and their crazy powers and costumes.

However, I just wasn't that taken with the characters and plot. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of films, but do we really need scene after scene of whiny teenagers talking about their feelings? Personally, all I really want from a Spiderman movie is some fun web action and a few zingy one liners. And a more interesting villain than the one we got here.

Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I always thought the point of superheroes was to be focused on others - saving the world and all that - not endlessly dissecting their own emotions and obsessing about their families and relationships. Guess this just reflects the world we live in: a Spiderman movie for the me, me, me generation.",6/10,11 June 2023,RogerRoger77,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),NEGATIVE
Feel disconnected from the fan base after watching this.,"Either this movie is getting it's score bumped up by bot accounts, or I watched a ""mid"" version from another dimension.

I'm honestly baffled by all reviews that I've seen for this movie. It's far from a masterpiece, but the critics who are speaking out against the film are seemingly doing so for clicks. Filling their ""review"" with zingers and half backed complaints about the movies undoubtedly fantastic art direction and animation.

This movie falls flat when it comes to pacing and plot. The first half of the movie had me engaged, despite drawn out character moments (which are arguably needed, I'd just argue they could flow better and cut down on runtime) and the fact that we don't see Miles get pulled into the main plotline until a round half way through the film had me loosing some interest admittedly. This was something reviewers took into account for other films, like the first of The Hobbit trilogy, so why does this film get a pass?

I was definitely ready to check out when we got to the scene on the bridge in Mumbai and Gwen was the only one to get an alert about a breach in the ""cannon"". How we can we blame Miles or Gwen for doing a sloppy job when the writing is sloppier? Why didn't anyone else present on the bridge get an alert? Why didn't Pavitr know about this cannon event like everyone else? When it's heavily insinuated that all of the Spider-Men/woman working for Miguel know about all of this stuff and are actively working to avoid a multiversal doomsday event.

Excelsior!,"Amazing. Spectacular. Sensational. Marvellous. This movie is a celebration of art, a celebration of culture, a celebration of superheroes and comic books, and a celebration of the one and only Spider-Man. The most ambitious, vibrant, bombastic, stylistic, feat in animation history. And an incredibly unique soundscape and score that feels sonically refreshing. This film is gushing with personality. It's unprecedented. It's unmatched. There is no competition. There is no doubt. This trilogy is going to be the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. Take notes MCU. Take notes everybody. This is how you do cinema. Excelsior!

This is something truly special,"I don't even know where to start. I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!

This sequel stands tall alongside Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day as one of the worthiest successors of a pre-established masterpiece. But it's not only a masterpiece, it's a true work of art. It lies one step above masterpiece. It's a Renaissance painting come to life. You can just randomly pause at a scene and take a screenshot and it'll be a beautiful wallpaper. I thought Into The Spider-Verse was the pinnacle of superhero storytelling. Man, I was never this wrong. I'm telling you this blows Into The Spider-Verse out of the freaking water. It not only reaches new heights. It tears up the sky and shoots you beyond the stratosphere. I am shocked to the core at how revolutionary this movie is. I have never seen anything like it. The experience I had in the cinema is nothing short of spellbinding. This movie had me strapped on tight in my seat right from the get go, then had me in a suffocating stranglehold, refusing to loosen its grip, let alone let go, and throttled me towards a rollercoaster ride of emotions and feelings, I don't even know how to react.

This is a mindblowing experience that left me speechless at times, laughing for the most part, and utterly petrified by its closing hour. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire time, I never felt the 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime and it felt like I was right there beside the characters. My jaw was wide open the entire time, I could not believe what I was being exposed to. And I thought watching Infinity War and Endgame was the high point of my moviegoing experience. No, this is not only a cinematic experience I will never forget. This is something else entirely. This is something special. This is a cinematic miracle. The fact that they pulled this off with flying colours is insane. Everybody is firing on all cylinders. From the seamless blend of countless different animation styles, the striking colours, the stark contrasts, to the deliberate compositions, this is a visual feast unlike any other. This is a textbook testament to the creative potential of animation. There can be a scene with two people talking, and the background is filled with so much detail. Every single frame, shot and sequence is meticulously devised and painstakingly choreographed. It's lively, it's dynamic, it's moving.

And amidst the dizzying array of visual cacophony lies a story that chronicles what it means to be Spider-Man. Again Miles (alongside his fellow Spider-companions) is flung head-first into wave after wave of emotional peril, exploring themes of adolescent isolation, complexities of growing up, and finding where he belongs in this vast expanse of multiversal entropy. He is put in situations that tests his resolve and integrity as a human being and as a universe-hopping superhero, clashing with different Spider-people when they present conflicting ideologies. And the way the creative team executed these moral dilemmas is nothing short of intelligent and mature by not giving us any easy or simple answers, but making us question along with the characters what the right decision is and what we would do if we are in their shoes.

Not to mention, The Spot turned out to be one of most menacing villains ever to have graced the silver screen. He started out as a goofy ""villain of the week"", but then more layers get peeled off and we get to witness this 3-dimensional sculpture of a misunderstood and unfortunate guy sucked into the wrong end of a calamity. They actually made us care and understand where he's coming from, why he is the way he is, and why he's doing what he's doing. And the new Spider-people all have distinct personalities and some of them get to really shine under the spotlight. The core of the story doesn't ever get lost amidst the wild collection of cameos and Easter eggs. The team behind this franchise show that they have formed a tightly-knit kinship about what they are cooking up and what kind of a story they are trying to tell.

Also, when the action settles down, the dust clears and the superheroes take off their costumes, the movie does not get less interesting. This is a grounded drama as much as it is a superhero spectacle. The dialogue in this movie is so sharp and witty, it cuts like a water jet. It takes what the first movie established and built upon that foundation by deepening the relationships of the characters and weaving more intricate elements into Miles' journey of self-discovery. And we get to just marvel at the complications and how it all plays out. Everything is laid bare. The characters are put front and center, flanked by breathtaking visual ingenuity, sharp sound design, powerful voice acting and Daniel Pemberton's sublime musical presentation.

This sequel is more than a sequel. This is the best Spider-Man film ever made. This is the best superhero film ever made. This is the best animated film ever made. This is the best film of the year and possibly the best film to have come out in recent years. And it's not even close. It is a love letter to the Spider-Man canon, poking fun at familiar tropes but not forgetting to inject fresh oil to keep the engine purring. They went above and beyond for this. Every single aspect here screams perfection, from the calculated directing to the slick editing.

There is not a single nanometre of a weak link. The web of life and destiny is woven with tour-de-force cinematic artistry. I am telling you that we are witnessing the birth of one of the greatest film trilogies ever made in cinematic history. I have no reason to doubt that Beyond The Spider-Verse is going to be as excellent as its era-defining predecessors. This is truly a flawless achievement that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the conclusion. See you next March!",10/10,5 June 2023,hoshouchian,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
The greatest animated film of all time.,"I went into this movie expecting it to be good but I didn't think it would surpass its predecessor 'Into the Spider-verse'. Boy, was I wrong and I've never been more happy to be wrong!!! Not only is this the greatest Spiderman film ever, I'm going to take it a couple of steps further and say that its the greatest animated film of all time and a top 5 comic book film of all time. I'd put this movie in the same tier as 'The Dark Knight', 'Avengers: Infinity War', 'Logan' it is THAT good. This movie was an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I fully expect this movie to sweep the Oscars for animated films and I expect it to be a candidate for film of the year!!!! I highly recommend everyone go see this film asap.

"Thank You, Sony.","I think this is actual cinema perfection. No joke, this movie has all of it. Insane plot and insane execution. The animation is a great to even view and it dazzles you every second of the way. Being an enormous fan of the 1st (#1 favorite movie of all time) this topped it. This is my new favorite movie of all time. The ending with Miles turning out to be the prowler in his dedicated universe had my jaw on the floor all the way home. This is one of the best movies created and it is this generations The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. I'm so excited for Part 2 and I want to say from the bottom of my heart, this is the best movie Marvel has ever made.

Can we skip to 2024 now?,"I've heard about Into the spider-verse for a long time and yet I haven't seen it. Until Across the spider-verse arrived. So I decided to watch it. After watching ITSV I keep asking myself ' Where Am I? '

After watching ITSV for 8 hours Now I'm ready for ATSV. When I walked out the cinema I was shocked. Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! I ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now. Every frames are absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Every characters are full of heart. The story is beyond my expectations and I'm sure that yours too. Just three words for it ""I Love It""

Wow! That is all I could think when this movie ended. It had big shoes to fill and my god did it deliver.,"95/100

The Into the Spider-Verse garnered much praise for its unique art style, and this sequel takes it to a whole new level. The homage to both classic and current comic book art is truly remarkable. Across the Spider-Verse looks like a masterpiece that belongs in an art museum. This is the kind of cinematic experience that keeps me coming back to the movies.

However, it's not just visually stunning; it has depth and substance. Despite introducing more characters, each one is fully developed. In the first act, we delve deep into the family matters of Miles and Gwen, which adds an intriguing layer to their characters. The emotional pay-offs in the third act are incredibly powerful because of the excellent groundwork laid earlier. Every character's journey feels relatable, and the choices they face are genuinely difficult. It's impressive how this animated film manages to evoke such profound emotions. And with Beyond the Spider-Verse still to come, it seems we're in for even more of these satisfying pay-offs.

Moreover, the movie is delightfully self-aware. It cleverly pokes fun at the Spider-Man tropes we've seen recycled countless times, generating plenty of laughs along the way. Jake Johnson's portrayal of Peter B. Parker is as hilarious, if not more so, than in the first film. Daniel Kaluuya's Spider-Punk had me chuckling with every line he delivered. The well-balanced humor provides a perfect counterbalance to the movie's darker moments, which are expertly executed, particularly thanks to Isaac Oscar's outstanding portrayal of Miguel. I didn't really expect the movie to go this dark, but thank god it did. It really worked.

This film is absolutely spectacular! There is no doubt in my mind I just watched the winner of the Oscar for the best animated feature.",10/10,31 May 2023,jelco_ajax,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),POSITIVE
How 'Across the Spider-Verse' Left Me Hanging: An Honest Review,"I thought I'd watch it when the film was back in theaters. It was a disappointment for me. The concept is very nice, but it didn't carry the movie. The animation style is good from an artistic and aesthetic perspective, but it makes understanding the scenes difficult. It's very hard to grasp what's happening in most scenes. As for the plot, it's unnecessarily long and overly complex, and leaving the ending open-ended was a very wrong choice. Aside from all that, I found it generally unsuccessful in conveying emotions to the audience. Throughout the movie, I felt almost nothing, and there were moments when I was quite bored and disconnected from the film. There's a lot more to say, but I won't extend it further, partly because some of it would be negative. Considering that I'm a serious Spider-Man fan, you can somewhat understand why I was disappointed.

Best Picture? Best Picture.,"Across the Spider-Verse has done the impossible: be better than Into the Spider-Verse. And by leaps and bounds too. The animation is spectacular. Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.

Id give it 6.5,"Normally I'd round 6.5 up to a 7 but I'd begrudge doing so for this fare. The art style blew me away in the first one and it's pretty good here but not good enough for a free pass. I don't know why they had to make it so long for it to end on a ""TBC"". For me it sums up how I feel about this movie that I don't even care how this finishes, sure I'll probably watch the sequel at some point on a Sunday afternoon. The villain is hardly in the movie and it's just expecting me to sit back and enjoy the various settings and characters, which if this was the first film in this style would be enough. Glad I didn't fall for the hype and spend money at the cinema.

Non-stop Chaos,"I have no idea how this movie has so many positive reviews. I went to watch this with high hopes and left feeling like I just spent 2 hours inside of someone's head with a bad case of ADHD. It was moving so fast that there was no time for plot development, character development, and certainly no way for me to retain any of what I just watched.

I'm giving it two stars for the animation, because I can always appreciate that someone put effort into something that required some creativity. But that being said, I remember almost nothing of that movie except how boring it was. It was moving so fast that it was completely impossible to actually enjoy, or even absorb it.

I really hope the fine art of filmmaking isn't being lost when I see so many youths think this is what a good movie is supposed to look like.

A true Masterpiece,"This type of movie is the type where you're going to watch it 10 years later and still say this movie is perfection. It took the animation to a whole new level and it made a big leap in the animation world that all the companies will have a big challenge to compete with it. And I'm sure the impact will stay for a decade at least just like avatar and the matrix movies.

The cameos and the little details that not anyone will notice it like spider-man fans it makes the story even better.

And saving the best for the last, story and the plot, i cant talk much about it because of it will contain spoilers but if there's a sentence to describe it. It was a true masterpiece.

I really doubt that we will get the same level of this movie in the meantime but all I can say this movie os ahead of its time.

Somewhere in the middle for me,"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.

Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.

The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.

I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.

Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.

In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.

One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.

Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.

Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.

Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.

In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.

After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?

However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.

For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

I rate it a solid 9/10.",9/10,19 October 2023,MrDHWong,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Not the masterpiece that was hyped,"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.

Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.

Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.

Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.

"Mr Scorsese, I wish you a very long life","I never heard of Osage Nation before this. It was a 3 hour 26 minute education not just of the oil wealth and of American Indian culture but of sensitive filmmaking crafted so beautifully Michelangelo would have cried. Lily Gladstone has a classic, timeless, renaissance Madonna face and Robbie Robertson's tender score embellished her sensitive performance perfectly. True to Mr Scorsese's form, it ran so long and needed a deus ex machine ending that while innovative, brought (for me) the film to a premature end. Dessert was served too soon. Otherwise, I could not say a bad thing about this show. Mr Scorsese, I wish you a very long life so you can continue your master craft for mere mortals like me for a long time to come.

Grim & an hour too long,"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.

I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.

The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?

For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.

A bit disappointing actually...,"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.

But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.

Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.

Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.

Killers Of The Audience's Bladders,"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.

This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.

It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.

A true story every American should know brought to the screen beautifully by its actors and director,"First of all, I would like to address the reviews that state this film is about pushing ""liberal white guilt"". It is not, it is a true story with villains who were tried and convicted in the American court system after an investigation led by the conservative head of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover. I highly recommend that everyone reads the nonfiction book of the same title by David Grann prior to watching this film.

I was fortunate to see an advanced screening of this film yesterday at the Zurich Film Festival. Martin Scorsese certainly satisfied the monumental challenge of bringing this story to the cinema. The actors fully possess their tragic and complicated characters, especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone (who I hope to see more of). The score, cinematography and featured songs only contributed further.

Despite its length, the rather abrupt but appropriate conclusion left me feeling melancholic to depart this cinematic masterpiece and it has remained in my thoughts for hours since. Please go and watch this film and recommend it to others once you do.

Will someone tell Marty he needs to edit his movies down.,"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",6/10,20 October 2023,Features_Creatures,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...,"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.

The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...

The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.

How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.

There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.

Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...

Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !

Coyote want money,"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.

Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.

Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.

There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.

As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.

In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.

Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.

Read the book,"Positives: I loved the casting. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, and Lily Gladstone did a fantastic job in this film.

Covers the book well, touching on most of the major highlights of it.

Negatives: I read the book and that was 1000% more intense, paced well, and left you hanging on every word. The movie revealed everything to us in chronological order in a very slow fashion, thereby eliminating all suspense and mystery.

The movie was 1.5 hours too long. Martin could have cut down the movie and made it more concise by highlighting the greed of white man when they struck oil, how many of those men swindled Osage out of their fortunes, covered more of the introduction of J. Edgar Hoover and the birth of the FBI (all of his trials and tribulations, including mistakes made during this investigation), included some small but crucial moments like mentioning that Ernest was Mollie's guardian, bring up that Lizzie's death was suspected posioning, reduced some of the cinematic shots that Martin seems fixated on (you'll know when you see them), and I wish he introduced this movie from the perspective of the FBI.

"Emotional, brutal","This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.

Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.

All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?

I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",8/10,19 October 2023,jpismyname,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
tough watch,"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.

I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.

One of the greatest movies in years.,"As the title says, I believe this is one of the best movies we have seen in many years. To start out, the acting is just incredible with DiCaprio, Gladstone and De Niro all at the top of their game. I was very hyped for this movie and I wasn't not disappointed. Despite the 3hr 20m runtime, this movie goes by in an instant. You could watch it 3 times and it would only feel like you'd watched the original runtime. The score, the acting, the story, the cinematography, the writing, the directing, it's all absolutely masterful and incredible. I would one hundred percent recommend this movie to anyone.

A Disappointing Failure in Editing,"Martin Scorsese has produced a lot of all-time great films. Lately he's made overhyped and under-edited time wasters.

The history of the willful execution of the Osage people to swindle their oil wealth is an important tale to tell. With incredible actors to tell the tale this should have been a masterpiece. It was with this in mind that I was extremely excited to watch this film.

Instead Scorsese's inability to make proper cuts to his films (see The Irishman) makes an otherwise well told story a drag. Good moviemakers know how to compress good books to fit a two to two and a half hour window. He seems to have lost this ability and the result is too many redundant scenes that are repeating the same dialogue.

This is especially the case with the constant manipulation between De Niro and DiCaprio, both of whom put in captivating performances even if they are inappropriately cast as characters that are supposed to be decades younger. Multiple scenes between the two could have been removed with only positive results.

The ultimate conclusion to this film is predictably clear after about an hour, yet it takes well over two more hours to get there leaving much of the audience exhausted and disinterested by the end. This is such a disappointment and a disservice to this subject that I actually felt anger towards the director instead of the people who perpetrated such atrocities against the Osage people.

People eating this up,"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.

The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.

DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.

The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.

The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.

Wonderful Remembrance for the Lost Osage Oil Heirs,"Killer of the Flower Moon

The film tells of the Osage Indians, who after finding oil in their land, are riddled with mysterious deaths within their close knit community. Focusing on the lives of Mollie Burkhart and her family, the film pieces together a slow but harrowing awakening of a small family built under false pretense.

Okay, shocked how well paced the film is.

Interestingly, it took an different approach to the maximalist and ""Hollywood"" styling of Oppenheimer - a film I personally hated. It's just very direct and slowly build its story up.

It opened talking about how and why they are killing, how the White men of Osage is hateful and would use everything to get above the ""unworthy"" Indians - not so much glamorization just pure unadulterated hate.

It slowly quivers into much more sinister murders while it posits that the Osage's does know that they are targeted. In addition, the film posits that the Osage's are also a victim of new found wealth. A bunch of them where not in particularly great shape NOR does any take action (sans Mollie) with growing deaths in the area, which is a neat commentary to compliment the deadly ruthless ness of Hale.

The way it told the story reminds me so much of Edvard Munch (1974). Its pretty precise and almost documentary-like fashion. The details are direct yet substantial. And given that this is a true crime film, has elements that is both ""Anti-Suspense"" and ""Anti-Western"" that worked tremendously AND compares quite nicely against Marty's flashier fare.

And all and all, it just hits perfectly without being too much and also commenting fully on all sides. Everything was particularly fleshed out for your judgment. Its clearly for the Osage BUT is willing to show the problems on their side too.

The only real negative I would say about the story is how they handled Molly and her husband plight. They were somewhat trying to make it a story of love crossed against his Uncle's wishes. I wish they took a harder stance in his overall portrayal. That man did not love that woman - just from what the screen shown.

In addition, I think Scorsese was not particularly confident in portraying her. She was fully supporting all throughout the film AND that felt like sad for a film ABOUT the Osage Indians.

Performance-wise, even with a less screentime - Gladstone ate the scenes she was in. Her simple but effective presence gave depth in a character that is shoved behind the scenes. Sadly, I think the Oscar's would surely bump her down to supporting BUT she deserves that win. Di Caprio and De Niro is subdued AND wonderful in respective role. Plus points for De Niro's pitch perfect accent work. Very consistent to be honest.

Also, I particularly love how the sound in this film is mixed. Lot of silence in this one BUT compliments the slow burn element of the film.

Highly recommended BUT has some flaws.

Killers of the Flower Moon,"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",7/10,19 October 2023,CinemaSerf,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Extremely Long & Incredibly Morose,"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.

Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.

On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.

Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.

For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.

This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.

Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.

Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.

Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.

As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.

They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.

It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'

At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",5/10,18 November 2023,reelreviewsandrecommendations,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Miscast and Overlong,"The film is ultimately hampered by its miscasting and excessive length.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are both undeniably talented actors, but they are simply too old to play their respective roles. DiCaprio is 47 years old, but he is supposed to be playing a man in his early 30s. De Niro is 79 years old, and he is supposed to be playing a man in his early 60s. The age difference is distracting and makes it difficult to believe in their characters.

The film's runtime of 206 minutes is also excessive. The story could have easily been told in 2.5 hours or less. The film's slow pace and meandering plot make it feel much longer than it actually is.

True Cinema,"I'll have to confess that this is my first Martin Scorsese film --- I've heard legends and myths about Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street, but never really got the chance to watch them. And therefore it's really hard to describe what makes Killers of the Flower Moon a scrupulous, captivating, and evocative piece of true cinema. Perhaps a particular setting with blinded windows reminds me of Frances Coppola's The Godfather; perhaps the inter-dialogue silence reminds me of the Coen brother's No Country for Old Men; perhaps the occasional dark humor reminds me of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction; or perhaps the ""made by Scorsese"" label influences my judgment. I could not tell exactly, but the work itself showcases craftsmanship which I have never before seen. Specifically, all the discourses in the movie are presented with incredible precision, whether in terms of cinematography, character layout, script writing, lighting, or plot progression --- the directing is just flawless. Take away the exteriors, the film actually narrates quite a simple story: scammers slash murderous getting exposed. And yet, if we put it into the historical context of Indians versus whites, plus the elements of interracial romance, detective mystery, and humanity, something suddenly clicks.

I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio has performed an ""uglier"" role than Ernest Burkhart --- even his Calvin Candie in Django Unchained is bestowed some maniacal comicality. Physically, Ernest is stout, stained-teethed, and always frowning like a wrinkled pumpkin, prompting me to wonder if his actor is seriously the same guy who played Jack in Titanic. What makes Ernest truly loathsome is his character: avaricious, spineless, frequently imprudent, and often foolish. Most disgustingly, he is faithless --- hinted at start by him not attending churches despite being Catholic --- when promised profit and protection Ernest abides by his uncle's game, yet when regret overwhelms after the death of his daughter he immediately chooses to testify against Hale. Ernest represents the banality of evil during the Indian persecution; unlike Hale who masks his guile and malice beneath the complexion, Ernest is simply incompetent. What more could be said about a man who claims to love his wife while feeding her poison daily!

Lily Gladstone will most definitely be nominated in the next Oscar for her role as Mollie. Throughout the first act, the lady is demure, well-dressed, graceful, but shrewd, observant, and aloof --- her trait is almost the perfect epitome of the Indian culture. It is for these fascinating qualities that make her schemed fall so tragic, into becoming bereft, fragile, sickened, disheveled, and vomiting one's heart out on the sweat-soaked deathbed. The Native Americans made only one mistake that was fatal in their fight against the intruders: for being too quiet, for being too patient, for being too kind.

What an exciting year for cinema! Nolan's got his Oppenheimer, Scorsese with Killers of the Flower Moon, Ridley Scott's upcoming Napolean, and Hayao Miyazaki with The Boy and the Heron. Can't wait to watch their competition at the Oscars.",8/10,23 October 2023,dorMancyx,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
No one does it like Scorsese,"Scorsese's done it again. Killers of the Flower Moon is another masterpiece, or close to it. I have next to no complaints. It finds the legendary filmmaker at the top of his game (he's been there since 2013 it seems, with an amazing unbroken streak), telling what might be his bleakest and most emotionally distressing story yet.

It was expected that a film about a series of real-life killings committed by greedy people against indigenous people was never going to be easygoing, but it's the execution here that counts. It's constant dread and an exploration of twisted, manipulative, and often downplayed evil (at least in the eyes of the evildoers) that's always in the shadows, and just hidden enough to ensure such violence continues. It disturbs and creeps up on you in ways that are difficult to anticipate or prepare oneself for.

It's an exploration of the death by a thousand cuts equivalent of atrocious, systemic murder. Seeing blatant crime against a race or group of people is troubling when it's out in the open, but in depicting it as both blatant and sometimes in a more insidious and calculated way, it makes you think about how many similar cases might've happened that weren't noticed or brought to light - not just in America, but anywhere with indigenous populations. It's here where Killers of the Flower Moon isn't just powerful for the specific story being told (and it is), but for what it suggests on a broader level.

It's like Shoah, in that way - the lengthy and soul-crushing Holocaust documentary from 1985 that is as much about the horrifying banality and numbing effect of great, widespread, non-stop evil as it is about laying bare what evils were committed. The pacing and length of Killers of the Flower Moon are essential to conveying these things. Having to spend so much time with this story and these troubling themes makes them all the more impactful.

The film's beautifully shot, masterfully edited, and the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro - are all deserving of awards recognition. Those who thought The Irishman dragged might feel the same here, but I thought it earned just about every minute of its 3.5 hour runtime.

Complaints? DiCaprio contorts his face like a bulldog the whole movie - I only noticed at about the 2.5 hour mark, but I couldn't shake the mental image. It's still a great performance, and the character he portays here is unlike any other he's ever played. There is also a sense of creeping familiarity to parts of the final act, but some interesting turns are taken. And then the ending... the final scene and then the very last shot are both brilliant, and helped the film end on a powerful note. That being said, I do expect the final scene to be divisive. Good, I think.",10/10,19 October 2023,Jeremy_Urquhart,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Great actors, lovely scenery, far far too long","Just back in from Killers of the Flower Moon.

Sad to report that what could have been a taut and thrilling portrait of the evils that men do for money - particularly when it comes to acquiring the money that belongs to people they look down on, is instead a ponderous meditation on wickedness.

On the upside, Di Caprio is convincing as the idiotic foil, caught between the schemes of his uncle and a genuine affection for Mollie his Osage wife, and De Niro is always watchable even when he verges on pantomime as the conniving villain, while Lily Gladstone shines as Mollie .

The script and even worse, the edit is where my issues lie. It is simply far too long and the large parts of the film proceed at a snails pace.

Rather like the portrayal of the Tulsa race riots at the start of the Watchmen TV series, it does shed light on an ugly slice of 20th century American history, but for a film that purports to champion the cause of the Osage people (and perhaps remind Us citizens of the plight of first nation Americans in general) it provides them with no agency at all. Despite their new found riches they are presented as largely passive, often easily duped and in need of saving by the good ol' FBI (though only after receipt of a fat old fee).",6/10,22 October 2023,johndavidson-1,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
OH MY GOSH,"I just saw in a special screening this movie . It's absolutely fabulous in terms of the direction . All of the actors give amazing performances , especially the actress that plays Molly ( sorry i don't remember her name ) , Robert de Niro and brendan fraser ( although his sceen time was little ) . I understand why some people may have problems with the runtime , i think it's as long as it should . About the theme of the film also maybe it's not for everyone and at some times it becomes a bit more depressing than you already expect , but i think it could easily become a classic . It deserves all the hype and more and i have to say although the enormous runtime , everyone should see the movie on the big screen .

"Lifeless, passionless storytelling","Given Martin Scorsese is one of our great filmmakers I was expecting much more from the film. Dicaprio was his usual hard-working self, capturing the loathsome character that would be part of a scheme to murder Native women for their oil rights, and as his wife Liliy Gladstone had a powerful stillness and tragedy about her, but the film itself had a very lifeless, going-through-the-motions quality, as if Scorsese were too afraid of disrespecting the events to bring any of his customary pizazz or excitement to make it anymore than scenes of stitched-together exposition. Very disappointing film.

"A Testament to the Power of Cinema, But I Can't Overlook Its Problematic Narrative.","Killers of the Flower Moon is a special film. I saw it in IMAX over the weekend and couldn't help but be swept up in the majesty of this film. It's absolutely gorgeous; not just because of the amazing Oklahoman landscape that stretches forever, but the incredible set and costume design that, over the course of the film's first 40 minutes, brings you into the world of the Osage Nation and the town of Fairfax before the narrative begins in earnest.

I honestly loved this part of the movie; it felt so immersive and impressive. When Scorsese intercuts black and white footage and photography, it's really peak cinema. This is honestly one of the most historically immersive films I've ever seen. Yet, it still feels like a Scorsese film; with its quick pacing, use of montages, and copious amounts of (sometimes dark) humour. This isn't really a slog to get through; despite the runtime, I found myself engaged from start to finish. It's a testament to Scorsese's storytelling and the work of the editors to rein this thing in.

On the topic of what I really liked, I feel like the performances were all (for the most part - more on that later) excellent. Not just DiCaprio, De Niro, or Lily Gladstone, who are all phenomenal (even if I had problems with some of their characters). More impressively, it's the side characters, the other people who make up this world who impressed me most. A lot of the people felt like they were ripped straight out of the 1920s and so, so true to life.

The sound design of this film was probably the biggest reason I'd recommend seeing this in IMAX. It's so good that there were several moments that during the film, I legitimately thought someone was speaking or making sounds next to me. To say it envelops you and brings you deeper into this world would be an understatement.

As for the plot of the film itself, Killers of the Flower Moon is positioned as a crime film and with that in mind, it feels like a return to form for Scorsese. However, the film never loses sight of an aspect of these crimes that inherently makes them *feel* different from Goodfellas or Casino or The Departed. Simply put, you can't watch this film or understand it without considering the overarching themes of white supremacy and exploitation. As much as we are told to the Osage are a wealthy, prosperous people, it's impossible to ignore how none of this protects them in a society that fundamentally does not recognize them as equals. You can almost feel the tension from the screen, as the murdered Osage men and women come to terms with this.

There are some scenes in this film that really stuck with me; a particular murder that is shown towards the end that is conducted so coldly and ruthlessly that it honestly gave me chills. It's hard not to be moved by this film and it's obvious - especially by the ending - that Scorsese really cared about bringing this story to life and into public consciousness.

Yet, I find myself a bit uncomfortable with this film. From a narrative standpoint, it follows Leonardo DiCaprio's Ernest, a WWI vet who comes to Oklahoma to work with Robert De Niro's William Hale, a local businessman and (as we learn) crime boss. I'm going to say this unequivocally: Ernest was not the right person to center this movie around. There's almost no mystery or tension because Ernest knows the scheme his uncle is pulling from the beginning. Ernest participates, motivated by money, yet Scorsese tries to make him feel sympathetic, emphasizing that he genuinely loved Mollie (Gladstone). I don't buy it and it feels like a weird direction to take; to be clear, as dumb as Ernest is, he is complicit in every murder that takes place and to paint him this way was a huge misstep, in my opinion.

I genuinely wish this film's narrative was more...Scorsesesque, jumping from character to character to explore the EPIC nature of the story, but also to give us more perspectives. The Osage kind of come off as naïve and easy to fool, Mollie in particular, as we don't get a good sense of the time scale between the murders. Further, as much as people are raving about Gladstone's performance - which is well deserved - her character is criminally under utilized. I would've even preferred more FBI stuff to emphasize the ""murder mystery"" aspect of the film. As it stands, it feels like it's a movie about a white guy who is taking advantage of Native American people, but feels REALLY bad about hurting his wife (but...not her entire family?) I couldn't help but feel Scorsese dropped the ball on this.

Also, Brendan Fraser...my man, what happened? His - admittedly short - feature in this film was by far the worst performance of the entire thing. He's overacting, yelling, and feels out of place in what is otherwise an extremely well-acted movie.

While flawed, Killers of the Flower Moon is a movie I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it. It's a truly magnificient example of cinema's power, handled by an incredible auteur. I feel lucky that we get to experience Scorsese and it's obvious he hasn't lost a beat.

Very Disappointing,"Killers Of The Flower Moon was a film that I have been looking forward to seeing for several months now. I have only just started going back to the cinema to watch films, but only really for films that I really want to see. Killers Of The Flower Moon fell into that category.

It ticked all the boxes, a Scorcese film starring Dicaprio and De Niro? Yes please. I was, however, massively disappointed. I think the cinematography is pretty good, and the acting was quite good too (especially the always great Dicaprio), but that was about it for me. I'm not one to see a films long run time and be put off by it, in fact there are some great films that over two and a half hours and sometimes even three or more hours.

Unlike Oppenheimer, I don't think Killers Of The Flower Moon warranted the three and a half hour runtime, could have easily cut forty-five minutes to an hour. The time wasn't really the reason why I didn't like it however. I just didn't feel like the film ever got going, its sort of the same monotonous pace throughout the entire thing. Ultimately, I don't like it when people say they don't like a film because it was 'boring', because more often than not that just means they didn't understand what was going on. Despite understanding the plot and what was going on, I have to say Killers Of The Flower Moon is pretty bland in truth.

All in all, I came away from the cinema feeling quite underwhelmed and disappointed, somehow Scorcese took a really interesting part of history and turned it into a pretty unengaging slog. Overall, its not bad, its just that you expect a bit more from Scorcese given his track record. Overall I'd give it an average score of 6/10.",6/10,28 October 2023,sweetkieron,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Powerful and Gripping,"Incredible, powerful film. This movie got me thinking about the horrors of life, and just how far some people could go due to greed, or by someone having major influence over you.

Set pieces were great, cinematography on point, the music was great and the directing, and of course the acting was phenomenal by Leo and De Niro. The one superstar of this one I would say was Lily Gladstone, who played her role so well with such grace and fervor and I am now a fan. I am fiending for a rewatch already. Oh, and the writing of course was phenomenal. I find no flaws in this one, bravo Scorsese and company.

A let down to fans of the book.,"The book was one of the most gripping and thrilling books Ive ever read. Its my favourite book by far.

The movie changes the entire dynamic. The book was written as a detective mystery with twists and turns and an unravelling conspiracy. All of that is scrapped to give Leonardo DiCaprio screen time.

The main character of the book (the detective) is almost entirely cut out from the movie and is replaced by the absolute most boring character from the book - Earnest Burkhart.

Why they didnt have Leon play the detective is the only mystery left. His performance was the weakest Ive seen Leo and the story was completely butchered.

Where are the protagonists and antagonists? Wheres the beginning, middle, and end?

Wheres the climax?

Wheres the momentum and the pacing?

This movie was well made but it sucks hard. A huge missed opportunity. If you loved the book I recommend skipping this one entirely.",6/10,30 October 2023,romanlabbee,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
"Oscars for Scorsese, De Niro, DiCaprio, and Gladstone!","With masterful storytelling, impeccable direction, and exceptional performances by DiCaprio, Di Nero, Gladstone, and the rest of the fantastic cast. This movie left an indelible mark on me. Scorsese's latest creation is a cinematic landmark that feels like a natural progression of his fabulous film making career, delivering a powerful and thought-provoking experience that engages the senses and nourishes the soul. A true testament to his creative genius, this movie is a must-see for film enthusiasts, reminding us once again why Scorsese is a true master of his craft.

Give this movie all the Oscars possible, I haven't been captivated by a movie like I did with this one in a long time! Must see for all movie-lovers!

Another Martin Scorsese masterpiece.,"This is what cinema is all about, a wonderful storyline, with terrific acting, and a stunning visuals.

Scorsese has an impressive backlog already, this instantly goes into that list of classics, I was super excited by the announcement and the trailer, I was not disappointed.

It isn't an obscure piece of US history, but it's one that isn't often spoken about, it definitely makes you think about events.

Lots going on, you have a mystery, you have plenty of manipulation, and there's a little bit of the violence that you'd expect, though it's rather toned down I thought.

Visually jaw dropping, it looks sublime, the sets and costumes are incredible, absolutely spot on, and those cars were incredible. A large number of extras make several scenes look pretty epic.

It's a long film, I was glad the cinema put an interval break in the middle of it, at no point did it feel slow, it didn't lull, it flowed at a fine pace.

The twist at the end had the whole cinema gasping, what an unexpected moment, I can't think of a time where Scorsese has used such a plot device, I did not see that coming.

The acting was flawless, everyone played their part, personally I see DiCaprio coming away with a big award for this one, he certainly deserves it.

Don't be surprised to see this pick up a number of awards.

Far too long,"Sorry to say that this was far too long for the cinema. I found the Irishman far too long as well, however I was able to watch that at home from day one, which made it a much easier viewing experience, enabling me to take breaks as needed, because of which I was able to really enjoy the Irishman Would have felt the same about this under similar circumstances, but it really is a very tough watch in the cinema. I try to avoid looking at my watch during a movie, but couldn't seem to help myself during this one, on each occasion to see that only a few minutes had past since the last peek. I realise I wasn't helping myself much with that at all.

It's not boring, it's just NOT a cinema film. Something only for the comforts of home, where you've got the option to treat it like a mini series. If this was a mini series for TV it would have been fantastic, but as a movie for the cinema it makes for an extremely taxing viewing experience.

I must also admit that I started to go down with a nasty cold during the film, which might have affected my feelings towards it, however went in feeling perfectly well, as far as that goes, and came out quite sickly, and so the movie was evidently long enough for something like a cold to take hold!",6/10,21 October 2023,DirkDiamond,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Less is more,"Before a premiere, I try to steer clear of trailers, reviews and other opinions. I just got a glimpse of a few loving reviews. Nevertheless, my expections were high because of Scorsese, De Niro and DiCaprio.

I hoped for a masterpiece, but this isn't one. It's a very well told story, that's historically relevant. The greed motives are very well implemented in this movie. As expected, the acting and casting was pretty good. De Niro was great, Leo did well (although at some points it felt a little over the top), but Lily Gladstone stole the show for me as Mollie. There's only one big BUT that doesn't make me give this a higher rating.

I looked a LOT at my watch too see how long was left. I don't mind slow pacing, but this is just too much. There's not really a point for this to be 3.5 hours long. In The Irishman I wasn't bothered by it. Now I was. Every other aspect was good - but not great.

The costumes, camerawork and scenery were lovely.",7/10,2 November 2023,jordverburg,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Disappointed,"Far too long and it could have been better balanced. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the investigation side: how that actually came about after she went to the president and how that team was put together. It seemed to have far too much of Robert De Niro (probably because it WAS Robert De Niro). I'm afraid Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was average and didn't get across any real reasoning for some of the actions his character did and didn't do. Lily Gladstone WAS superb and some of the looks she used to communicate her thinking were brilliant. The supporting cast were great as well. It's worth a watch but it isn't a film I'll ever invest my time in again.

Poignant and artfully constructed story,"A greatly paces melancholic story. I have to mention the actors that brought out the emotion of the characters so very well. Every time Lily Gladstone is in the frame you always have a sense of sad foreboding and she carries that role so well. Even with the mildest dialogues, her expressions, body language are so exact that they tell the story in just that. Dicaprio plays his role to utter and absolute perfection, you always have that sense of irritation that he is going to say or do something idiotic through out the film while also sympathising with him. De Niro just gets under your skin the entire time, another perfectly played part. The story itself is extremely sad and infuriating at the same time, and I am happy to have watched this film and learnt about these native tribes and people. Even the length of the movie didn't seem a deterrent it did not drag at any point. Exemplary film making.

The Novel Was a Great Script On Its Own,"During pre-production it was in the news that Eric Roth the Academy Award winning writer who co-wrote the script was at Logger heads with Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo was supposed to play Tom White - the lead FBI Agent who solves the whole plot but is highly understated in the film. The script was re-written to accommodate him and he changed roles.

Tom Cruise, Leonardo Dicaprio, Will Smith, etc are great actors but have way too much creative control that sometimes it is not a good thing. Had Apple Inc hired lesser known actors which this film needed and a non-fussy director like Francis Lawrence this movie would be battling Oppenheimer at award ceremonies.

All they had to do was stick to the script which reads like a movie. It is in the last chapters of the novel that the audience know who the killers and their leader are. But in the film we get a hint who it is in the opening hour and a while later definitely know who is calling the shots which make the whole film way too long.

Marty is losing it that is why he can't get funding at traditional studios and has to get it from streaming companies.",6/10,11 January 2024,skyhawk77,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
What a disappointment,"Well that was a real snorer.

Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.

Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.

Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.

Go read the book instead.

so incredibly disappointed,"I was anticipating this movie like crazy let me start off by that.

Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio & Robert DeNiro? I would be stupid not to be excited .The trailers were amazing, I would literally recommend everyone to just simply watch the trailers because it is not only the best parts of the film shown in the trailer, but the whole plot as well. I love long movies, I really do, but there is nothing worse than a horribly paced movie. Not slow burn no, this was horribly paced. When were first introduced to Osage its so cool & interesting, but that interest dissipates within the first hour. My three stars is for this : The fact that it is a period piece, the costumes and set feel authentic.... and ...... well nothing else honestly. There's no music really at all, Im a strong believer that a good movie is where visual expression , meets a musical expression, meets a human expression. If ya know what I mean. The aspect of this film that made me loose.any interest was this one fact. I couldn't understand the fact why it was told from Ernest and not Molly. Really . It was so boring, from the first ten minutes we know , that DeNiro is the bad guy who's going to sway DiCaprios character we know right away.. I wish we got to spend time with the Osage people & their richness, I never once felt that Ernest (DiCaprio) loved Molly (Gladstone) . Everything about them felt rushed. & the whole ""it's about greed, he really loved her but greed took over he couldn't see how terrible it was that he was poisoning her"" Please.... how could you poison the mother of your children and claim to love her ? I know Scorsese loves to focus on the human aspects of the "" bad guys"" and usually it's a home run for me, but this time it was such a strike out. If it had been told from Mollys POV we could have had inside views to the richness that the Osage people had, their lifestyles, we could have felt comfort in that money, till Ernest comes around. She falls in love and its an earnest love . Her heartbreak when her family members keep dying, who can she trust ? & not in a ""whodunnit"" way, in a real way. Showing one's emotions when you don't know who to believe. I wish we had seen the King from the Osage peoples eyes, they believed him he was the white man they ""trusted"" for a long while and I wish we could have had that trust built to be broken . It was such a long movie there was definitely the space and the budget. The whole time , the minute earnest gets off the train this is how I felt: This guy is going to do anything is uncle tells him, his uncle is bad news he s the rotten egg in the bunch , the girl won't realize till its too late, of course the white people are working against the osage people. It was predictable, & the ending was very weird too I have nothing to comment on it , truly like three hours just to wrap it up like that? I wish for once this was told from a different side. It was like a god awful boring western ( even though it isn't a western) .

Emoting in Silence and Crisis,"Martin Scorsese makes long movies; he makes gangster movies and villainous movies and movies about men who sink with their choices; but they are always long. He has made a career of painstaking attention to detail, and of getting the most out of a scene, and those scenes linger. Think of Travis Bickle blowing it on the phone with a date. Think, more famously, of Henry Hill, showing off the trappings of his mafioso nightlife. Scorsese gets close to his films, and he tells a complete story - a three-hour story, often, but one that's dense and absorbing, every time. I knew and expected this going into ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" Probably not all of his audience will be so willing.

A hundred years ago thrived a rich and intelligent community of Osage, owners of Oklahoman land meant to be worthless but floating on oil. In flocks the white man, coyotes, seeking a bit of fortune from these Osage; wooing their women, building them schools, and trading them goods. If any of these white folk were well-meaning, they were those who left them be when the cards were on the table. A kingpin of these folk, William Hale, has ingratiated himself within Native American society like a fattening tick. He means to take everything. In this film Robert De Niro plays an exceptional sociopath, single-minded and unconflicted, who becomes responsible for the murder (that is, the poisoning, stabbing, shooting, burning, exploding, and garroting) of dozens of these Osage.

But the soul of this film lies between Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and Ernest (Leo DiCaprio): Mollie the Osage heiress of a black gold fortune, and Ernest the dimwitted, charming nephew of Hale. Their relationship and the events within are devastating on a level I've rarely seen. It would be a disservice to dissect it in a review meant to get you to see the movie, so you'll have to take my word on their performances - stunning, perplexing, distressing, and nuanced. I don't fawn over Leo but I've never seen him better.

Something I've been dying to talk about is the balance of dialogue punctuating ""Killers"". Moments that tell you the most about a character are often when they say the least, white man and Osage alike. Scorsese omits subtitles in some scenes so you're scrutinizing Leo and Lily's faces as they speak her language, until suddenly you realize you didn't need them to understand. Leo's relaxed charm in the first act is later juxtaposed in U-turn fashion with contorted, confused, suffering grimaces (which apparently has people questioning if his jaw was wired). Lily conveys unimaginable heartache with simple glances, her eyes like fates, knowing how it's going down but unable to change it. Until her last appearance on screen, she's magnetic. Don't be surprised if three Academy Awards for acting home in on the three leads.

In a film of such Godforsaken girth, there is so much of ""less is more"" put on display. It's stated explicitly as a trait of the Osage - they waste no breath when it isn't necessary. And William Hale spends the whole film yapping.

This here's a beautifully shot bit of legitimate non-fiction which reeled me in from the start and held my attention to the end. It won't work for everybody (and already hasn't, according to some of my friends). In some other universe is a shorter cut of this film, leaner by perhaps an hour, and more of a thriller than a contemplative tragedy. As a trumpeter of this version's excellence I'm satisfied, but even I thought some scenes languished. No matter. With acting, writing, and cinematography of this echelon, I'd have sat through a fourth hour.

8/10 for being alive at the same time Marty Scorsese is making magic.

Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Shines Light on Dark History with Powerful Performances,"I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, the latest film by Martin Scorsese, based on the book by David Grann. The film tells the true story of the Osage murders, a series of crimes that took place in Oklahoma in the 1920s, after oil was discovered on the land of the Osage Nation. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, among others.

The acting was quite successful, especially by DiCaprio and Gladstone, who played a married couple caught in the web of greed and violence. They portrayed their characters with depth and emotion, and their chemistry was convincing. De Niro was also good as the ruthless villain, who orchestrated the killings for his own benefit.

The subject was realistic and well adapted, showing the historical and cultural context of the events. The film did not shy away from depicting the racism and injustice that the Osage faced from the white settlers and the government. The cinematography and production design were impressive, creating a vivid and immersive atmosphere of the period.

However, the film had some flaws that affected my enjoyment. In some parts, it was hard to understand how much time had passed or what was happening. It seemed like people were dying all the time, but these were things that happened at long intervals. People were in and out of prison, babies were born and grew, but there was not enough indication of the timeline or the transitions. I also got confused by some of the names mentioned, as there were many characters involved in the plot.

Other than that, the first half of the film was good, engaging me with the mystery and the drama. I got bored for most of the second half, except for the end, which was tense and satisfying. The film could have been shorter and tighter, without losing its impact.

My general opinion is still positive, as I think this is an important and powerful film that sheds light on a dark chapter of American history. I would recommend it to fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio, or true crime stories.",8/10,23 October 2023,0xkerem,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Over hyped like many films now,"Oppenheimer and now Killers of the Flower Moon..so hyped but somewhat of a let down.

So much dialogue that was often mumbled. Few moments where you thought it was building to something a little more exciting and then it didn't.

Spectacle it was not even though acting was fine due to leads.

Sets were terrific depicting the time period and one could be entertained by the set decoration and costuming but the story even though based on real life events just felt flat.

Scorsese dropped the ball with this one as it really just rambled on.

Watch it at home as not worth the inflated cost of seeing it at the cinema.",6/10,27 October 2023,arnie83-910-103092,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
It's...GOOD,"After I saw the reviews for this movie I started having low expectations for this but this is a masterpiece. Really great performances, nice plot and it wasn't boring at all. Not Scorsese's best but neither worst. The first half was really good and I started thinking: why is this movie hated by so many?

I wonder if it will win any Oscar prize because it was better than any movie launched this year. Unless like in Oppenheimer, the trial scenes weren't boring and I could watch the entire movie without constantly checking the time.

I know it could've been at least one hour shorter but it was still great. Definitely don't regret watching this and I recommend it to everybody.

What I Saw Was Not What the Critics Saw,"I was extremely excited for the release of this film and am sad to say that it has missed the mark. With an all star cast, directing from Martin Scorsese, who is one of the greatest directors of all time, a compelling premise, and glowing reviews, I felt sure that I would walk away from Killers of the Flower Moon feeling satisfied. Instead, I felt that Scorsese had missed the mark in his flawed (though not awful) film.

I'm a huge fan of his numerous works, and the 3.5 hour run time sounded like no trouble to me. I love plenty of long films, even Scorsese's last film, the Irishman, of almost the same length. In this movie, the runtime is completely unearned. So many scenes go nowhere, so many more scenes are comprised of repeated, and often unimpactful dialogue. The ultimate plot of this entire movie can be summed up in a paragraph. The first ~45 minutes of this film has quite the hook, but from there it it meanders and drags along. I can't help but feeling with a reworking of the script there is a more compelling and interesting way to take the direction of this story, but it misses the mark.

Speaking of the film's direction, I am baffled by the choice to focus of the character of Ernest. None of the characters have much of any depth, including Lily Gladstone's character, Mollie. I thought her acting was excellent; but while Gladstone shows emotions well, Mollie as a person is uninteresting. It is difficult to get invested in any character, especially DiCaprio's and De Niro's characters, King and Ernest respectively. These two share the same shallowness as Mollie, except the viewers know right from the beginning that they are unlikeable villains motivated by greed. This is all before mentioning that none of these people experience a personal growth throughout the film.

It is difficult to get invested in watching this film with the stale characters and drab pace. I found the tone of this film to also be a distraction. Generally, it is incredibly dark and serious, which makes the frequent moments of attempted humor so ill-fitting. DiCaprio is usually at the helm of this humorous side, who I felt did not bring his A-game to this project. His performance is noticeably less compelling than both his co-star's; and the perpetual frowning face DiCaprio dawns throughout the film is genuinely distracting. His range of emotion seemed confined.

I felt like I was not viewing the same film as the one I had heard in the critical reviews. There was such a lack of subtlety, depth, and especially tension throughout this film that feels like an unfortunate case of poor execution. That is not to say it was garbage - in fact, Killers of the Flower Moon has many redeeming qualities. From its generally great acting to an amazing variety of set design and fantastic shot composition, the beauty and wonderful aesthetic of this film is hard to overstate. It even gets emotional, though, it lacks any suspense for being a mystery-murder plot. The plot as a whole was generally predictable and repetitive, being at its best during the beginning and end of the film. It didn't help that all throughout there was almost no character growth. What holds this story movie is the dark nature of the fact that it is a true story. It is very disturbing, and it is good that more of the public be aware of the real people that got affected by greed and corruption. But this movie is not a masterpiece. It does not do justice to its source material, and it fails to live to its enormous potential. It's flawed enough that it is not even really worth a watch, from my perspective. It's dreary and stale overall, leaving me ultimately disappointed at what could have been.",6/10,22 October 2023,frowningtable,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
"Brilliant, Hard Hitting, and Powerfully Acted","9/10. Expertly crafted, powerfully acted, brilliantly edited, and filled with hard hitting, dense themes. Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon showcases his talents as an auteur, spellbinding filmmaker.

This slow burning, epic drama earns its three-and-a-half-hour runtime. Yes, I was quite concerned with the length also. But it's not really a problem and only drags on in a couple of scenes. The length allows Martin Scorsese to take his time and really invest in the story. This is his unflinching view of a horrific, true story about the gruesome murders of the Osage people. It's grim, gritty, and very sad. If you are looking for a fun, lighthearted ride with tons of action, funny one-liners, and a happy ending; then you are looking in the wrong place.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives his usual tour-de-force performance. He is my favorite actor, and he scores a huge touchdown with his role. He brings subtle nuances to his conflicted, complex character. Robert De Niro still proves his acting chops for his age. I haven't really heard of or seen Lily Gladstone in anything. Wow, her performance is captivating, amazing, and powerful. Leo and Lily deserve Oscar nominations for their performances.

This film is not an easy watch. There are a bunch of themes to digest and chew on for a while. There are many characters and gets a little hard to keep up with all the names. Luckily, the editing is very tight and keeps you invested throughout the long runtime. Martin Scorsese has been making movies for decades and is one of the very few who can pull something like this off.",9/10,20 October 2023,Batman9003,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Hard to Enjoy, Nothing to Remember","I've just finished this slog of a watch, IMAX no less, and I can barely recall a moment of cinematic power or movement, and am only left with long repetitive conversations in dark rooms.

It's well made of course, and captures the era incredibly well, but it just refuses to get moving, both as a film, and as a piece of moving drama.

Again and again the same plot ground is covered. Again and again the same pained performances are perfectly churned out.

Felt like a version of There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, and Heaven's Gate blended into a joyless hodge-podge of Colonial cruelty. A tale worth telling, but maybe not for 3.5 hours in one sitting.

Well worth a watch, once, preferably at home, with the benefit of a pause option.",6/10,19 October 2023,michaeltheabbott,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
"Yes, the movie is long, but very high-quality.","First of all, regarding the technical aspects of the film, such as the cinematography and especially the music, they were quite remarkable and special. The IMAX experience was definitely worth it. The sound mixing was excellent; I was truly impressed.

I don't know how many generations Martin Scorsese has introduced to his films, but this is certainly a testament to the quality he's passed on to the latest generation. Everyone in the film delivers strong performances, but Lily Gladstone's performance is absolutely stunning. DiCaprio and De Niro are as great as ever, and there's not much more to say about them.

Now, let's talk about the length and pace that everyone has criticized. I'll evaluate both separately. In my opinion, the film is long, but it's not an ideal length for what people are saying could be covered in 2 or 2.5 hours; 3 hours is a suitable duration. The final 30 minutes did wear out the audience, but aside from that, I think it shouldn't have been shorter than 3 hours, especially given its length. The pace remained fairly consistent throughout, and I can understand why they kept it that way to maintain the tempo they established at the beginning and for its development. However, since the film was 3.5 hours long, I believe they could have included 1 or 2 rollercoaster scenes in the final 30 minutes.

I think it was valuable to pay tribute to the Osage people as well. The storytelling of the murders was of high quality and simple, especially the trial scene was well-placed without exaggeration. The Osage people's rebellion and council were very realistic; everyone portrayed their reactions without exaggeration. In my opinion, the film truly made it feel real.

Finally, everyone seems to be living for money nowadays, and this isn't a way to live life. Yes, money is important, but let's not make this world unbearable for the sake of it. There's only one world to live in for now. I want to thank Martin Scorsese for drawing me and everyone else to the cinema.

Boring. Fell asleep,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" promised a riveting historical drama, but delivered more of a cinematic lullaby. So much so, I considered it an unofficial collaboration with my pillow. While it aimed for tension and suspense, it was more successful in inducing yawns. The visuals, occasionally eye-catching, felt like sprinkles on an otherwise plain donut. Even the star-studded cast seemed to be in a race to see who could make the audience snooze first. The film had potential but ended up as the cinematic equivalent of a bedtime story - and not the exciting kind! Watch at your own risk of unexpected napping.

Breaks my heart to say this but...,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.

I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.

Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",4/10,22 October 2023,cinemasaver,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Garbage for anyone but the most deluded fans,"I'm someone who's no fan of the Marvel state of cinema at present, but this is just nonsense from Scorsese. The plot is wafer thin for the runtime and fails to grip you at any point, the characters are unlikable, uninteresting, and as a result there are no stakes. Because there's stakes there is no tension. Like none at all, for 3 and a half hours.

I'm actually quite surprised Leo took the role because his character's limited dimension prevented him from doing anything interesting. There is very little in this movie to entertain you and no artistic scenes to grip or inspire you. Really weak stuff.

Keep your friends close..your enemies closer..,"Had the pleasure of watching this in the afternoon on a random Thursday as I had to take some PTO, in at 1 out 5 and still time to have a drink after before dinner.

Was a tough one not to go to bathroom, but was worth it to stay in the theatre for this as we were brought into the life of the Osage all those years ago.

Leo, Robert and Lily were all incredible in this and each made the film in their own way. I don't think it would be success without them especially Lily Gladstone.

Hats of to Martin Scorsese at the wise old age of 80, still doing amazing work for the cinema. Ridley Scott coming out with Napoleon next week. They're going to be hard to replace in the coming years...

Can you find the wolves in this picture?,"An extraordinary and well crafted picture by Martin Scorsese .

Holds a lot of emotions by these massacred souls of Osage and the set up of the story was cohered and we get in the heart of story immediately . I should praise the introduction of the characters every single character introduced in a quickly smart way make us involved in the middle of big and small events in the movie and hang with characters. Its horrifying point of view to the story and the whole murdering and wasted spirits by the greed of the heavy wealth . What a performance from DiCaprio one of his best acting performances ever , De Niro proved again that he is the best actor in entire history by this contrasted character , Gladstone was perfect acting choice she had done on of the most perfect female performances in last years .

The movie is long but without a single boring second on it . The film contains transformations in characters and twists in events and introductions of a number of characters with their moral conflicts and intentions, and all this progressed in a genius way in the film and so that the film is not exhausting was in short chapters as a break from the style of the film and it was fun breaks btw .",10/10,18 October 2023,mohamedhosssm,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Too Long!,"Very disappointed in this film with two exceptions: DeNiro and Gladstone. They were excellent. I can't stand DiCaprio so I was not surprised by his over the top, ham acting...at one point (when being interrogated by the feds) I swear he's doing an impersonation of Brando in The Godfather. It may be time for Scorsese to hang it up - he's apparently forgotten how to say ""cut"" but his ego is still kicking' with not one but two appearances! If you have to see it, wait until it's on demand so you can turn on the closed captioning - Lily Gladstone's voice is barely a whisper. Or just skip the whole thing and read the book.

Interesting Truth Telling if a true American Horror Story,"My Review- Killers of the Flower Moon Directed by Martin Scorsese My Rating. 8/10

This movie is the 10th collaboration of Director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro and the 6th with Leonardo Di Caprio on a feature film and it was obviously a passionate movie project for this incredibly talented trio.

With an estimated production budget of $200 million it will need to exceed extremely well at the box office that remains to be seen.

Does it deliver ? A resounding yes in my opinion the trouble is it takes far to long for this impressive movie parcel to arrive .

At 3 hours and 26 minutes this factual original American Horror Story set one hundred years ago is really a truth telling tale concerning the multiple murders of approximately 62 Osage indigenous land owners in the rich Oklahoma oil fields during the early 1920's .

These murders were virtually left uninvestigated until a delegation of Osage Indians travelled to Washington appealing to President Calvin Coolidge for assistance and justice.

I know Martin Scorsese is the greatest advocate for Cinema being seen on a cinema screen but I'm certain even his 80 year old bladder would need relief after sitting for nearly three and a half hours .

I bet he pressed the pause button in his luxury home cinema when viewing the Final Cut.

Truth is I think this would have made a great mini series or would have benefited with some skilled editing or at least some trimming down .

Remember when epic movies like Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia had an intermission?

However as expected the cinematic scope of this movie is impressive as are the performances of DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart the rather weak but charismatic nephew of William Hale his much smarter incredibly Trump like Uncle played by Robert De Niro and I suspect his Trumpian characterisation was not unintentional.

The standout performance for me was from Montana born Lily Gladstone who grew up on a Blackfeet reservation and gives an incredibly understated but incredibly powerful performance as Millie Burkhart .

Millie was the indigenous Osage wife of Ernest Burkhart her wealth and family inheritance or headright is a prize that William Hale uses to encourage his nephew to propose marriage.

Killers of the Flower Moon is a story of greed and exploitation of the indigenous land owners who by an accident of fate when driven from their original tribal homes in the late 1880's to the dusty plains of Oklahoma literally struck oil.

The movie opens in the early 1920's to images of an incredibly affluent and prosperous community where an entire ecosystem of greed and graft quickly arose around the Osage capital of Pawhuska and neighboring Osage city of Fairfax, keeping the money flowing and keeping the white locals including the newcomers in control of it in the guise of Guardianship for each Osage Native American citizen.

The White settlers courts legislated if any member of the Osage Nation died, their headright would pass to their legal heir.

This person might be their white spouse, who was often conveniently also their guardian. Or the headright might go to a relative or heir whose guardian already had complete control over their accounts - so that the money would effectively go straight to them.

No spoilers this information is just meant to set up the scenario of murder that follows.

The screenplay co written by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese is based on a book by David Grann is excellent but far too lengthy and drawn out for one movie sitting.

The score is also very effective and composed by Robbie Robertson who sadly passed away a few months ago .

I thought Killers of the Flower Moon told an interesting story very effectively with a great cast including Jesse Plemons as the Government investigator Tom White and 2 interesting cameo performances from this years Oscar winner Brendan Fraser who plays the trial Defender and John Lithgow as the trial Prosecutor Peter Leaward.",8/10,19 October 2023,tm-sheehan,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
The reviewers seem to agree on a score of only 6.1 stars... More realistic if you ask me.,"What surprises me most is the very high score this movie received. Because at the moment of writing, it scores 8.0 stars on IMDb. And with almost 100k people having voted, this is a very high score. So if you use IMDb scores as a guideline for determining what movies or shows to watch, it is a no-brainer to decide to watch this movie...

I decided to read some reviews from the people that watched it. And I also decided to calculate the average score of what those reviewers gave. And surprisingly, these people seem to agree on a way lower score. If I for instance take the top-10 reviews, they seem to give an average score of 6.1. And the top-20 seems to agree on a similar average score of 6.2 stars. A score that I think is also way more true to reality...

And why I do agree with them, is not too difficult. For one, it is the plot that is very thin and predictable for a movie with almost 3.5 hours in duration. So thin that I lost interest in quite a lot of moments during the long sit. And that is despite all the famous actors you see.

I even think that if all famous actors would be replaced by more unknown ones, this movie would go in the history books as an irrelevant production. So yes, I think it is unfair that this movie gets a rating similar to productions like 'Kill Bill', 'Groundhog Day', 'Jurassic Park', 'Finding Nemo' or 'Bridge on the River Kwai'. Because those iconic movies are easy to recall many years after I watched them. And 'Killer of the Flower Moon' neither fits this category, nor will I remember it in a few years time...

So with an estimated budget of 200 million USD (!), I think the viewer does not get something that is worth such a huge budget. A budget that seems to have been spent on a lot of famous actors. Because for sure there is no lack of high-grossing actors. Even the smallest of role - like e.g. A lawyer that you see only a few minutes - is taken by actors that by themselves can carry the main role of any other movie.",6/10,5 December 2023,Erik_Surewaard,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
Every frame is delightful,"The cinematography of this movie is increíble , you could print almost every frame of this film and hang it in you living room as a piece of art.

The acting is one of the best I've ever seen, DiCaprio's ability transform into a completely different character on every movie he makes it's one of a kind. An De Niro is just perfect as always .

A story about how América was built , manipulating and destroying the good heart native people !

Instant classic , and a film that tries to to say a lot , and accomplishes it perfectly. I strongly recommend this movie to people that appreciate cinema, music and photography.

A Movie Trying Hard To Be A Masterpiece,"Acting was incredible for the most part from majority of the cast including lily gladstone who I thought was fantastic.

This movie had the story to be a classic, however it was an hour to long.

It is my opinion that this movie tried so hard to be a masterpiece that it got lost on the story and made it a tough grind to watch, many scenes were slow and drawn out I feel like this is where the story lacked, it's like it was an open field day for actors to showcase their ability however that made the storyline and the enjoyability of the movie suffer.

Still a good movie by most measures, but did not deliver.

Masterpiece!,"Just saw KOTFM and a few words I can use to describe it are epic, heartbreaking, and colossal. I'm still processing everything but here are some quick first impressions:

1. Film is visually stunning. The sense of place and time in creating this world is outstanding. As an Osage from the reservation, the scenery is spot on. The clothes, the storefronts, the houses, everything. Was all perfect.

2. De Niro and Lily Gladstone had Oscar worthy performances. Their acting was phenomenal. Lily's presence in the face of horror and heartbreak felt so real and powerful, and she stole every scene she was in. De Niro's portrayal of Hale as being purely evil while also being gregarious and a pillar of the community was chilling. In my opinion this could be De Niro's greatest performance ever, and that's saying something. (Also loved Scorsese's homage to the Untouchables where De Niro played Capone, when he had Hale laying back getting a shave. Anyone else catch that?)

3. While the movie was long, it never got boring. Pacing worked. There was a constant bass beat later on in the movie that created a foreboding sense of terror. This really worked well imo.",8/10,19 October 2023,joekeene64,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Save Your money, Stay home and stream it","Somebody at the movie studio forgot to tell Scorcesee ""CUT!"" because this movie is so frigging long. 4 hours! We need an intermission, it's so long.

Some scenes drag on and on and on and I wanted to yell, ""hurry it up"". It's a story that needed to be told but perhaps in a docudrama and not a fictionalized movie. And certainly with a better director. Better yet, maybe Scorcesee should have made this a 2-part series for Netflix.

DiCaprio (Ernest) and DeNiro (King) compete to chew up scenes. They both are capable actors but for some reason I only saw one emotion from both of them.

The story is about a true incident that happened to the OSAGE Indian tribe in Okla. I'm sure liberties were taken with the story. The Osage lived and owned land that was rich with oil. To assure that the oil land would be passed onto White citizens, white men married Indian women and coincidentally the wives died (prematurely by murder or fire) leaving the husbands the estate.

That same plan is what Ernest is urged to do by his uncle King. And one by one we watch Indian women die; Ernest even poisons his wife.

The story ONLY perks up and gets engaging when the wife goes to Washington and asks the President to intervene to find out why these women are dying. That's when the FBI comes in the picture and it becomes a crime drama. Much more interesting and more engaging.

But with that we are dragged through long long scenes between DiCaprio and the FBI and witnesses and Deniro (the uncle) and the wife and they go back and forth, and you just want to scream ""Get on with it."" This could be called typical Scorcesee. He's known to make long belabored movies. He won best director for the Departed, but that was such a snappy fast moving movies with all types of twists I didn't mind the 3-1/2 hour sit-through.

But this Killers Movie is laborious.

It's going to get a bunch of awards because the hype has already started and Scorcesee is promoting it all over the internet and TV. The only person deserving of a nomination is the lead actress. I don't think DiCaprio did anything unexpect from him, nor Deniro.

I still say save your money, stay home and stream it so you can take potty breaks.

Killers of my patience,"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.

Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.

It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

Oklahoma confidential,"The return of true cinema. An outstanding piece of art after a long time. The old Master rocks again. Almost four hour, a bit slow, yet you can't take your eyes off of it. Rodrigo Pieto painted the big screen with his camera. Top notch actings, solid script, compelling shots, Masterful direction, a very touching ending and all and all will pave the way for Killers of the Flower Moon on the road to the Oscar. It tells the true story about the first official case of FBI revolving the mysterious serial murders of Indian members of Osage tribe back in early 1920s in Oklahoma and the scandal that follows.

9/10 definitely.

When you have unlimited budget to make a simple movie...,"This movie shows you how to spent investors' money profusely without worries since the budget to make this movie seems unlimited.

This is a very simple movie, but since there's lot of dough lying around everywhere in the director's bedroom, he smartly found a way to use it at his will. So many unnecessary scenes were added, prolonged, extended. Huge amount of money spent on the settings, the costumes, the make-up. Lot of meaningless dialogues were thrown in to accommodate the unnecessary scenes...There are more despecable details that had added into this supposedly a regular 90 to 120 minutes movie, fully blown up to close to 4 hours long extravaganza, so tiresome and so boring to watch. It felt like you sat on the toilet, trying very hard to poo, but your chronicle constipation simply made it impossible to have a supposedly 5 to 8 minutes dump unlimitedly prolonged to almost 4 hours. That's what I felt when I watched this movie and, finally gave up in the end.

You really don't have to make it look like a masterpiece, or trying to make it an Oscar worthy big film. Sadly, this movie actually quite sucks. I was looking forward to watching this film thirstfully, you won't understand how I was disappointed at it.",No rating,28 October 2023,MovieIQTest,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
"Good story, perfect acting, but 45 to an hour to long.","When Martin Scorsese comes up with a movie, you immediately know it just has to be okay. Especially if the cast also appears on the casting list with names like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert de Niro, Brendan Fraser and so on. The names are not strange names in Scorsese movies. Of course, DiCaprio has already starred in The Wolf of Wall Street and De Niro in The Irishman. This time Scorsese does take a lot of time to tell his story, because the film lasts almost three and a half hours, so you have to schedule the film just as well if you want to visit it in the cinema and you also have to have a good piece of sitting meat. Incidentally, Scorsese's The Irishman also took almost three and a half hours, so it turns out to be a bit of a habit for the quirky director. Incidentally, this is not the first film about the Osage murders, there was already the film Tragedies of the Osage Hills in 1926 and later films such as The FBI Story (1959) also portrayed the murders.

Of course you can leave these kinds of jobs to Scorsese. The story is about a gruesome piece of American history, where the Osage- tribe was driven out by the white settlers at the beginning of the last century and managed to become the richest story people on earth in northern Oklahoma because they found oil in the soil where the tribe lived. As the greedy white settlers see this with great jealousy and do everything they can to be able to put their hands on the money of the Osage- tribe. The seemingly sympathetic William Hale, who is also called King, is at the helm to make the nefate plans. The role of William Hale is played by Robert de Niro and it must be said that it was really a long time ago that we saw the Niro play so terribly well in a movie. When his nephew Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, comes into the picture and drive around the rocky Mollie of the Osage- tribe for a while, it seems at first that the two fall madly in love with each other, but in the meantime nefarious plans are being forged. The first hour is therefore more like a love story, in which things are deepened and little actually happens. Still, you soon find out that Ernest turns out to be a real grease pipe, who doesn't turn his hands to rob the graves of the murdered Osage- tribe, rob the living and eventually gives the orders in the name of William Hale, to get people out of the way.

The second act delve deeper into the crimes committed and the poisoning of Mollie, who leads to diabetes and slowly but surely dwells with her insulin and looks death in the eye. The murders that are committed are really like Scorsese can only portray that, rough, disturbing and realistic. Still, it can be concluded that the film with its monstrous length of three hours and twenty-six minutes really lasts way too long. If the film had been shortened by about 45 minutes to an hour, the film would have been more accessible and really achieved its goal. Now sometimes you really have to struggle through the film, where you also have to be careful not to lose the thread. The third act of the film is the most interesting. When the FBI gets air of the matter and comes to take note of it. This is a brilliant role played by Jesse Plemons, led by agent Tom White. In the end it comes to a lawsuit and, well, you have to look at the rest yourself. The ending is really surprising and will also receive you with a strange look, not the denouement itself, but how it is told and translated to the screen.

Killers of the Flower Moon is dominated by grandmasters Robert de Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Yet they also do not know how to prevent the film with its monstrous three hours and twenty-six minutes sometimes becoming a really tough long-winded seat. It turns out to be a real test case for your sitting meat. It definitely doesn't get bad, but sometimes it's just difficult to keep your attention. Anyway, Scorsese almost never disappoints and he absolutely doesn't do that here. It is a gruesome piece of American history about greed, cunning and deceit. Don't expect an action movie or a smooth movie, no, Killers of the Flower Moon is a dormant project, which may not overflow from the action, but slowly works towards a climax as actually only Scorsese can. That the film is going to compete for Oscars seems to be a certainty, but with Oppenheimer and the upcoming Napoleon in his wake it becomes a true battle of the titans. Anyway, Killers of the Flower Moon will be one of the best films of 2023 anyway, and certainly end up in the top 5, but it won't be a movie that I'll watch for a second time soon. The film is just a bit too tough for that.",8/10,20 October 2023,michvanbeek,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Good not great,"This movie has pacing issues and could have been edited down. I wasn't very invested in the characters and it's hard to sympathize with some of the characters in the film. It's also way too long in the first act.

Not to say that it's a bad movie. It's good. But it is not as good as the hype suggests. I've seen other 3 hour films this year that were much more engaging and riveting than this.

The cinematography is great but not as good as Oppenheimer. The music score is dull and lacks a forward momentum. The story lacks drama because you know who is responsible. Some of Scorsese's other long movies have a lot of energy but this just felt like it was drawn out. It was also too difficult to follow because you are introduced to all of these characters you don't know and there is a lot of exposition.

A Masterpiece Tribute to Native Americans,"It's not only a masterpiece cinematically, and visually but also it gives tribute to authenticity of Native American culture, specifically Osage tribe.

The actors Leo, De Niro and Lily Gladstone play the characters so well. The visuals look stunning and rich. The natural places are captured in great details; the camera work is without a doubt a masterpiece.

Some of the editing tools that they used were breathtaking.

The plot even though longer ( could have been shorter ) was justified with great performances with great guest actors such as Plemons and Fraser. Fraser plays a corrupt lawyer that surprisingly looks stunning.

The story is about a mysterious cases of murders of Osage family ( The richest family in the world back then ); Earnest ( Leo), Bill ( De Niro ) are linked directly to this mystery. Not to spoil the key points of the plot; They both play the bad guys.",10/10,20 October 2023,ferozc137,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Very good, but...","The movie clearly pays its respect to the Osage community. Scorsese was really into the culture and also committed to the artistic part of it.

My critic is that the director focused on unnecessary aspects of the thriller and missed a little bit of the most interesting part which is the investigation and the trial. From a person who read the book I missed A LOT the FBI point of view. It looks too generic on the screens.

DiCaprio felt unnatural and for me it's not his best acting performance. On the other hand Lily Gladstone was an amazing surprise. Her facial expressions and the way she handled Molly Burkhart character was 10/10.

The ending is creative but at the same time ""rushed"" when the whole movie follows an extreme slow pace.

I was disappointed with the whole experience but it is still a great movie.

Ps: It bothered me that I had to deal with people leaving and coming back to the movie theater basically 10 in 10 minutes. What's wrong with people nowadays? They can't just seat and watch a freaking movie?",7/10,22 October 2023,giovanni_antonelli,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
A Martin Scorsese Picture,"This is cinema.

Killers of the Flower Moon is a harrowing, important masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers alive. It's a monumental achievement from the filmmaker who has brought us some of the greatest films in all of cinema - no one will ever do it like Martin Scorsese. This film truly showcases why he is considered one of the greatest directors to ever live! It's impeccable!

The film is an epic tragedy that is masterfully crafted. It's dark, devastating, and powerful. The film tells a horrific, yet important story that demands to be seen. It's a tragic rumination on greed and power. It's a murder mystery told from the murderers' point of view, packing a nauseating emotional punch thanks to how brazen its conspirators can be about killing a people they deem beneath them - for financial gain, no less - given how much power and political influence is on their side. Scorsese captures, in riveting detail, the sheer arrogance, stupidity, cruelty, and soul-eating evil of white supremacy. Killers of the Flower Moon makes an unsettling companion piece to The Wolf of Wall Street. The American dream at the expense of the easiest victim. And in this case, the business is genocide. Chilling stuff, and Scorsese wisely tones down any theatrics and goes as stark as possible.

I feel like when movies are described as ""educational,"" some people tend to look down on them. It makes a movie sound like a ""chore,"" or suggests that it's more concerned with being used as a ""teaching tool"" than with being a ""work of art."" But when I say that Killers of the Flower Moon should be mandatory viewing for everyone, I think it's perhaps some of the highest praise I could ever bestow upon a film - especially since it's because of this specific cast and crew's courageous artistic commitment to this story that it simultaneously holds said educational significance.

It's already astonishing that the story of the Osage has been swept under the rug by history as long as it has (if sadly unsurprising), and by telling this tragedy at all, Killers of the Flower Moon instantly asserts itself as important. But the way Scorsese tells it - with profound and unspeakably painful power packed into every scene, and a staggering sense of control over the entirety of the scope and scale of this sprawling story throughout - is what makes this telling significant, and, as of now, the definitive telling as well.

And by its sincerely surprising ending - an ending that left me speechless, with a massive lump in my throat - it had transcended beyond its biographical drama trappings to become something else entirely. Something far beyond what most films ever dare to dream of becoming: an essential existential enlightening, and a summation of all the love and loss that could ever possibly comprise one life, with an additional reminder of not just the very real evil that infests every inch of this world, but also a reminder of how we can't afford to ever allow anyone to endure it to this extent - or any extent - again.

Scorsese's two most prominent on-screen collaborators, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, are finally united in one of his films, lending it infinite star power. However, the real revelation here is Lily Gladstone as the wealthy Osage tribeswoman Mollie Burkhart, who falls in love with DiCaprio's chauffeur character, but soon begins to see her family and culture slowly die in front of her. Gladstone turns in a stunning performance that starts out as sweet and powerfully self-assured - but that aura soon slips away as if the life were gradually being drained from her body, and from her eyes. What Lily Gladstone did in Killers of the Flower Moon is astounding - the subtlety of contained emotions (pain, loss, angst all at once) entirely delivered by mimics of the face, it was remarkable to watch. She steals the movie in a film where both DiCaprio and De Niro deliver excellent, potentially career-best performances.

The film is brilliantly compelling, and asks tough questions with integrity. It's also delicately crafted, with excellent cinematography, production design, music, and editing. What especially keeps Killers of the Flower Moon interesting despite its epic length is its breakneck momentum, whether through Scorsese's fluid camera movements, editor Thelma Schoonmaker's propulsive cuts, or an expert combination of the two. The subject matter may be somber, but this is a Scorsese movie through and through, with a litany of minor parts played by instantly recognizable actors (like Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow) and scenes of snappy dialogue that make each bit of planning and plotting feel like something out of Goodfellas. It's disarmingly fun, but it also knows exactly how and when to yank you out of comfortable and familiar modes of movie-watching, with stark reminders of the viciousness and bloodthirst lurking just outside the frame (and often inside it, too).

The lengthy runtime has the advantage of making something heavy settle in the pit of your stomach for extended periods, not unlike the last hour of Scorsese's The Irishman, in which learning the details of a secret murder plot becomes stressful and harrowing. Only this time, the plan is visible for almost everyone to see - every white character, at least, and the camera is complicit, too - making it even more dread-inducing. It becomes all the more depressing given the ease with which violence is perpetrated against the Osage, even within the confines of supposedly just systems, which seem unlikely to convict white men of these crimes to begin with.

I implore you to give this film a chance in theatres. Let yourself experience the powerful tragedy, all the emotions, and really think about what the movie is saying. Then, once it's done, ask yourself: How long will you be complacent with racism? How long will you go along with something and not speak up?

It's one of Scorsese's most brutal films, yet one of his most thoughtful and self-reflexive, as he crafts a subversive murder ""mystery"" that leaves no lingering questions save for one. It's a question that defines the tide of American history: Just how far are people willing to go for greed?

There's not a single thing about this film that isn't flawless. I was left stunned and speechless. Urgent, unforgettable filmmaking from the first frame to the last. An astonishing, unsettling film. A cinematic masterpiece that will be studied for years to come.

A Great Story That Deserves to be Told but a Tighter Cut and Different Casting Might Have Helped,"Killers of the Flower Moon centres around 3 primary characters instead of a single protagonist. They're all interesting but in my opinion, they aren't all layered characters. I gravitated towards Molly Burkhart quickly (this was helped by Lily Gladstone's performance but I'll talk more about that later), she's quiet but strong and takes initiative while others are more content to just suffer through what's ailing the Osage tribe (several things are but a bad case of continual murder and theft are the primary problem). She also tries to see the good in Earnest even when there's so little on display. William Hale is closer, he's playing both sides, pretending to be a friend to the Osage nation yet having his own stake in the game through manipulation and coercion. His true motivations are never in question however and I could have used a little more time with his character's lighter side to perhaps feel some sympathy or understand his side of the story. I wanted to bond with Ernest but his lack of common sense is revealed almost immediately and due to his actions throughout the movie, I never wanted to side with him or was rooting for his success. I think this is all intentional, Flower Moon is a drama and ultimately a tragedy so this always how this story was going to unfold (you also have a duty to tell the story how it actually happened... instead of taking the American Hustle route). But even if that's the intention, you can't blame the audience for refusing to invest in all 3 of the protagonists and instead only empathizing with the one of main characters. This in turn will limit how much I engage with the movie because if the movie is predominantly being led by characters who are unsympathetic scumbags, why should I do anything but root for them to get their just deserts? This is so drawn out in the movie's laborious runtime that it dampened the enjoyment I got from the retribution, but more on that later.

Killers of the Flower Moon was hyped up with featuring 3 Oscar calibre performances. I would say Gladstone is worthy of that consideration and De Niro is close. I have to give Lily all the credit in the world, this is the biggest stage with some of the most talented people in their respective fields and she shone the brightest. She was a great casting choice and she fits this part like a glove. I had some problems with William Hale's characterization but De Niro hits all the right notes. He's affable when he needs to be, sinister when it requires and icy cold by the end. Scorsese-De Niro pairings have led to some legendary films and it's obvious to anyone that has seen any of those movies, they're a perfect match and they create special stuff together. I'm probably going to be in the minority here but I think Leonardo DiCaprio is miscast in Killers of the Flower Moon. His character is supposed to be an every man nitwit who is easily manipulated and he just doesn't fit as the yokel type. He's a great actor and I understand why Scorsese cast him but I would have gone another direction. The supporting cast is stacked but my favourite was newcomer Tommy Schultz as flunky Blackie Thompson who's darkly comedic in how blunt his delivery is. Killers needs a little levity here and there and he made me laugh with how resigned his character is to just doing everyone else's dirty work.

The trailers for Killers of the Flower Moon should have been advertising it as a Best Picture nominee (we all know it will be) and you expect a lavish production when you're stepping into the theatre. Killers definitely delivers on that front. The sets look fantastic, the attention to detail is great and it helps you absorb the world these people are experiencing. The cinematography is fantastic and the production design is top shelf. You can tell this movie was well funded and they used their giant budget effectively.

I was prepared stepping into Killers of the Flower Moon for it to be long but just like previous Scorsese flick The Irishman, even knowing ahead of time might not prepare you for how LONG this movie is. Conversely to the Irishman, this movie had a lot of fat to be trimmed off here. This is a good film but holy cow is there a lot of dead air in Killers. The story is fairly straightforward, there aren't many unexpected twists or turns to accommodate so the scenes of trickery and deceit all meld together. You have to take the movie how it is but I do think there was a more compact version of this movie that would have been more palatable.

I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did and I'm a little disappointed I didn't enjoy it more. This movie will be remembered fondly by most of the critical population and I feel like a killjoy. Killers of the Flower Moon is beautiful and has all the trappings of what should be the premier movie release of the year. But I liked it as opposed to loving it and I do feel like I won't be the only one who feels this way. I'd still recommend checking out Killers if you're intrigued but in terms of quality, I think you can wait for streaming.",7/10,21 October 2023,CANpatbuck3664,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Important subject, but overly long","I've rated this 8/10 because of the quality of the acting and the importance of the history this movie is based upon.

It appears though, that Scorsese, due to his previous body of work, has reached a point where people around him may be afraid to speak up particularly when it comes to editing.

Whilst beautiful to look at in many scenes, the movie is anywhere up to an hour too long for the events portrayed.

As an example, without giving too much away, there is a scene which involves fire and the same shot of human silhouettes against the backdrop of the fire is shown several times when once would've been enough to convey the imagery.

It remains a movie worth seeing, but the editing staff around the Director should have been more upfront with him and shortened or cut several scenes which fail to move the story forward.",8/10,20 October 2023,alan-nutter,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Good overall story, though way too long, predictable and mostly boring","This movie was at least 1 hour, maybe 1.5 hours, too long. While I loved the overall story, I didn't like the screenplay and script much. There were too many unnecessary scenes, that stretch out for way too long, while other bits and pieces that would have made the story more cohesive we're completely missing. Most characters were very one dimensional - be it pure evil, naive or powerless.

While I appreciate the story, the acting, the visuals the most part the soundtrack, ultimately it ended up being a very forgettable movie. In retrospective, staying at home and watching anything on Netflix would have been more enjoyable.

Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.

A very short 3 1/2 hour movie.,"Great film. Not sure how I want to describe it after that. It's a brutal story, but Scorsese doesn't dwell on the brutality side - he focuses on how the brutality affects the characters. In particular, It focuses on Lily Gladstone and how she deals as her family is slowly killed off. There really isn't any gore or gruesomeness in the film. The worst scenes have been in the previews so if you've seen the previews, that's what you will see in the film.

This is pretty much a Gladstone movie: she is not a supporting player by any means. DiCaprio is good as the catalyst to keep the story action moving. He's used as the pawn in DeNiro's clever game to get the oil fields from the Indians. His makeup is subtle but convey his sliminess. DeNiro, when he does drama like this, always does a tremendous job in the role: it's a ""Trumpian"" type role when he manipulates you to do the job, then he makes sure you're the fall-guy for the issue. It's a well made film that tells a fascinating story. All technicals are top rate.

The only issue I had was with the ending: not a bad thing/not a good thing -> just something I wasn't expecting and i'm not going to tell you what it was - only that I had never seen that type of resolution before and, in hindsight, it was a pretty nifty way to wrap the story.

Can't wait to see it again when it comes to AppleTV.",9/10,20 October 2023,661jda,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Powerful...Stays with you long after you finish its,"I went into watching this movie, blind, meaning, I did not know it was based on real events. Eventually, I caught onto the truth midway through which only served to intensify the horror of what I was watching. The movie paints both the beauty of love, perhaps even flawed loved, and the evil of humanity, with the focus on the latter.

The acting was so stellar that it felt like I was invading the private lives of real people. The last 45 minutes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat from intense curiosity, desire for some much need to comeuppance, and for absolute closure.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about some forgotten history, told in a brilliant way by Scorsese.

Killers of my concentration,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a film that showcases some remarkable talent, particularly with a strong cast and an impressive performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. However, the journey to the heart of the story feels like a road. The main issue lies in the prologue, which lingers a bit too long, testing the patience of the audience.

The film does have its moments, with cinematography that captures the beauty of the landscape and the historical setting. The attention to detail is evident, and the dedication to recreating a bygone era is commendable. It's a treat to see such a talented ensemble cast bring these characters to life, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.

Nevertheless, the slow start and prolonged setup can make it challenging to become fully engaged in the story. The pacing could have been more efficient, as the audience may find themselves waiting for the plot to gain momentum.

That said, the message conveyed in ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" remains significant. The film sheds light on a critical part of American history, addressing themes of injustice, racism, and the exploitation of marginalized communities. It's a reminder of the dark chapters in Americas past that still resonate today, making it an important and thought-provoking film.

In conclusion, ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" has a strong cast and impressive performances, especially by DiCaprio, but the lengthy prologue and slow pacing are just hard for your concentration. Nevertheless, its message is a powerful one, highlighting the historical injustices.",6/10,28 October 2023,Padi_2704,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
"Well chosen theme, hope many will follow","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by the great master Martin Scorsese and is based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Great actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, play a role in this piece and there acting again touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history. I must say that I am always enchanted by Leonardo Di Caprio's acting and every time I forget that Leonardo Di Caprio is acting instead of living the role, and this time it was no different.

In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth does not only bring good but thanks to white businessmen who ones again are looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible, it also brings bad. The story hides in a way a lot's of lessons but one must want to see..

I am very sparing in giving high scores, but this film well deserved it.

I won't praise the actors too much, with such a budget you can get the best actors, but they really contribute. For me it is mainly the theme, storyline and the progressiveness of Martin Scorsese that mainly influences my high score. I hope that many will follow and these people will be honored in their losses.",8/10,27 December 2023,soloyolonam,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Overrated and could be a 2 hours movie.,"I'll cut to the chase, since the movie was longer than it should have been, I'll do my review to save you time. This movie is good, and that's it, nothing more than that. And it could have been 1 hour less. We have 3 sequences in it, presentation of the characters and setting that lasts about half an hour, and we have two hours of repetition of the same idea that we already know is the central theme of the film, which as I said at the beginning could have 1 hour less, the most interesting part of the film and little explored is the last hour, where the FBI gets involved to investigate what's going on and that should be the focus of this movie, even I haven't read the book. DiCaprio and Deniro are not in their best performances, in fact I would say that it is one of DiCaprio's worst movies, I recommend waiting to see it at home through Streaming.

A rare film that can justify excessive length,"I remember when I first heard that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' was going to be 3 and a half hours long thinking what a slog it's going to be to get through. Some director's films are trending longer and longer and Martin Scorsese is certainly one of them. However, it doesn't necessarily have to be a death sentence for a film and as it turns out this was one of the rare exceptions where it was justified. I had a good time with this film.

Even though the film is very long, the story feels like it was demanding it to fit everything in. Very few scenes in the movie feel gratuitous. It's an epic tale and it needed to be told in the right way. The film also keeps its momentum going. It never feels like it falls into a lull at any stage.

It does help that the film has an amazing cast to carry every scene. There really are some captivating performances here and then towards the end there are some unexpected cameos which were an absolute treat.

I really didn't know what to expect with this film going in. The full spectrum was on the cards. I could've hated every minute of it, right through to it being one of my favourite films of the year. And everything in between. Not many films have that kind possibility going in. It probably won't crack my top 10 for 2023, but it wasn't far off. 8.5/10.",8/10,30 December 2023,jtindahouse,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Killers of time and more Scorsese dragged on brilliance/boredom in dialogue and drawn out imagery.,"We all can agree Master Scorsese can do what he wants at this point and he definitely does with his new yet again near four hour attempt at an Epic Tale. Unfortunately that doesn't mean it yields groundbreaking results or withstanding impressions like his past films of his prime. This film much like his last The Irishman is chalk full of brilliant actors and dialogue something that's usual for his films. Leo is always delivering an Oscar worthy performance. Where this movie can drag lies within its slow as molasses story. I'm not expecting shootouts and incredible heists from a based on true events tale but for the length of near four hours there's only so much talking and staring that can be withstood. While it most likely depicts what it needs to it could be cut in half and be more effective that way. The scenery is magnificent and the overall visuals are immense and worth the watch alone. The bottom line is that it's clear Scorsese wants to film talking more than anything which is fine for 2 hours but a bit winded at 4.

You'll enjoy it if you watch it as a short series.,"I wouldn't enjoy watching this movie in a theater due to its 3.5-hour runtime, which seems excessive for a film without much action or tension. However, when I watch it in 40-minute segments, it becomes more engaging as I witness the tragic story unfold gradually.

Excellent actors, cinematography, and direction, but I believe a 120-minute runtime would have been more suitable for a compelling movie experience. Scorsese likely wanted to take his time with this project, similar to his previous work. Despite my reservations, I appreciate the effort put into the film.

Observing a group display such a profound disregard for human life is sadly unsurprising. It seems that nothing has changed, and perhaps nothing ever will.

Very Well Made film but somehow fell short from being something epic,"For the first time I am seeing Leonardo Decaprio play the role of a character who is somewhat dim witted - not his usual sharp smart personality. But he played it beautifully.

Other characters were good but some of the acting of the side character didn't feel on point.

The story is a good one, worth watching but it feels like it centers around one family only. I hoped for a much broader picture that includes many cases of many families and overall situations and crimes against the osage people as a whole.

The story is not told on an epic scale but rather it shows just one case. There should've been more back story and other incidents. This is the only thing I didn't like, other then that everything else is mama Mia.

So unnecessarily long,"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......

"Surprisingly, I Liked It More Than I Thought I Would","The importance of addressing (and attempting to correct) gross injustices can't be overemphasized, and that's the key objective behind writer-director Martin Scorsese's latest release. This fact-based saga chronicles attempts by unscrupulous, two-faced White swindlers clandestinely (and sometimes quite brazenly) seeking to steal the considerable assets of wealthy Osage Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s after oil is discovered on their land. This tragic tale explores the depths that these immoral criminals would go to (including murder) in the name of unabashed greed, efforts ironically spearheaded by the local, smiling, allegedly well-meaning sheriff (Robert DeNiro) with the help of his dimwitted nephew (Leonardo DiCaprio), especially in their scheme to shamelessly pilfer the wealth of the accomplice's own wife (Lily Gladstone). The sweeping scope of this offering is indeed impressive, effectively brought to life by the fine performances of the three principals and an excellent ensemble of supporting players. And the stellar cast is backed by proficiently executed work in an array of technical areas, including production design, writing, cinematography and the original background score, making for a gorgeous picture to look at, all of which have earned ""Flower Moon"" a boatload of awards season nominations, with more undoubtedly to follow. However, the runtime of 3:26:00 - with no intermission - is a challenge to manage, even for the most patient and tolerant moviegoer. I streamed it, watching it in two parts, almost as if it were more of a TV miniseries than a standalone film, the only way I could effectively see myself getting through it. This handling of the story, in my opinion, represents something of a significant miscalculation by the filmmaker and the film editing staff - either cut the picture (which could have been done without losing much) or add a much-needed break partway through (which could have been accomplished without inhibiting the story's continuity). In my view, I believe that the second half was far better and more compelling than the first and that some of the narrative's more incidental detail could have easily been dispensed with without affecting the overall quality of the release. Still, that aside, it's obvious that this project was a labor of love for the director, one with a clear vision of what it wanted to say in relating an important and little-known story of injustice in a nation that professes to be a staunch champion of truth and virtue, and, for that, we should be thankful for the enlightenment provided here. This unconventional take on the Western may not feature the traditional cinematic interpretation of cowboys and Indians, but it nevertheless sets the record straight about who the real villains are, at least in this story, a lesson from which we can all learn.",8/10,31 December 2023,brentsbulletinboard,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Killers Of The Flower Moon is a perfect movie!,"Killers of the Flower Moon is right up there with Casino, Taxi Driver and Good Fellas. Its perfect from start to finish with stellar acting. I watched this Movie twice in a row, just to get all the little details that you miss during the first watch. Its flawless, maybe except for the amusing paddle break faux pas. Killers is easily movie of the year 2023. No contest. Where Oppenheimer came across as a highly polished, anemic 3 hours Car Commercial, Killers delivers actual emotional depth and organic flow of story.

All you heartless, brainless 1/10's. Yadda yadda, ""worst movie of my life"". ""My wife hated every second"". There is probably no hope for you :D

In closing Killers of the Flower Moon is beautiful next level cinema, and in time it will be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made. Not a shadow of a doubt about that. If you haven't already. Go see it. Bring time, snacks and a soft cushion for your keister. Movies do not get any better than this.",10/10,23 December 2023,pckq,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Needs a Protagonist,"I enjoyed the book, in part I think because there were no big name Hollywood types associated with any of the characters. I had the opportunity to determine who were the villains and who were the heroes.

The movie on the other hand is skewed with the villains (DeNiro and DiCaprio) consuming most of the 3.5 hours of screen time and dialogue. The heroes (Gladstone and Plemons) seem to get short shrift and the Osage people seem there to add credibility not character.

The movie would have benefited from an intermission, some thoughtful editing and less catering to the apparent egos of the headliners.

7 stars is generous!!

Controversial and necessary to tell written in a perfect way,"You may like some of Scorsese's films more or less, but there is no debate if we talk about the fact that he is one of the best in the art of film directing.

Although for many people The Irishman was a suffering, in my case I enjoyed it very much, despite its length. So there were no worries in my mind when it came to taking on Killers of the Flower Moon.

It was absolute cinema. A very well-cared for work from start to finish, brilliantly written and spectacularly filmed. An extremely pleasant journey through a very delicate story to tell, but one that was astutely approached.

If I had to highlight something about the film, it would undoubtedly be Lily Gladstone's brilliant performance. A little-known actress but who will undoubtedly be one of the faces of Hollywood from this moment on.

206 minutes of cinema, of which I would not cut a single minute.",9/10,19 January 2024,JulesAndVincent6,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Should've Been Longer,"I'll spare you a rundown of the plot as I encourage you to watch the film for yourself. I'd like to start off with some pros; the acting, the set pieces, the supporting cast. Now we'll address the cons, and there are many.

For as serious as the subject at hand is, the random moments of comic relief felt off and out of place but not too distracting. The handling of the plot was a bit disjointed. While there were talks about oil, and a random scene of the oil workers themselves, that subject is often neglected. Given the summary for this film on here mentions this, I assure you it isn't talked much upon all too much.

The film focuses heavily on insurance and the price of greed. But the way in which the random murders occurred for what reasons you could make out, it felt a bit too scrambled to truly grasp the connections for it to give a solid impact. Yes it was one murder after another, but the murders themselves weren't meticulously displayed with the proper impact. They were shallow and short lived.

While I take it it was done with intent, Ernest was insufferable. Also from the jump, his uncle showed his true colors from the first time they got to sit and talk with one another. The audience was in on the whole thing from the jump which led to no ""Ah ha!"" moments, or moments of exciting revelations. You just have to sit with knowing every time these individuals were on screen, they only saw people as money.

Which then leads me to my next gripe with the film. The relationship between Ernest and Mollie felt somewhat genuine, the fact that Mollie never once suspected anything is just too good to be true. The fact that you watch Ernest doing all these despicable stuff and then are suppose to believe that he loves his wife with all of his heart is a big ask. Divorce was inevitable and deserved. If the intent was to never like the main character then the film accomplished just that.

I'll end it with this, the ending was terrible. I understand the artistic side of things and I am all for that, but not with this film. We deserved to see those individuals get sentenced to life. We deserved to watch Mollie divorce Ernest. Mollie deserved to have her death shown with grace rather than a halfhearted obituary for the sake of art. The pacing of the film was done quite well and for it being over 3 hours it didn't quite feel like it. I would've respected the film a lot more had those things happened than the ended we got.

"Harrowing, depressing, too long but overall good cinema","This film is too long... sadly. It doesn't make you think too much which is a shame, it's too obvious and there is no mystery. From the outset you are cleared up on the evil and cunning details of De Niro's plan so therefore you are to sit helplessly for 3 hours whilst watching Osage people being murdered mercilessly without the murderers facing consequences. Now of course one assumes this is the history and how the story unravelled in real life however there is teaching modern day people of important storys in history and then there's hi expecting cinema goers to sit through 3 hours of unrelenting murder.

The acting lacked in the first half but the second half exceeded my expectations, De Niro was better than expected, DiCaprio had an exhilarating final 20 minutes and Lily Gladstone's acting was excellent however subtle at times yet still superb throughout. Gladstone's portrayal of a character with 'wise eyes' was the most authentic and scintillating I have seen in either a male or female character in cinema.

Could've been so much more but was still worth seeing if you love films and love cinema. The colour and costumes were very good and set design/locations were pleasing.

Killers of the flower moon is cinema at its peak...,"In early era of cinema filmmakers didn't used to have a big budget, VFX, CGI or any kind of those things which are essential to make modern movies what they had was just a solid story that could be adapted into a good screenplay and some good actors who can act well to keep audience engaged throughout the presentation well this movie honors every thing that represented cinema for a long time in history since early age..

Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro don't need any kind of introduction they are the legends of the Hollywood and they are back again in this masterpiece based on a true story that will keep you engaged for 3 hrs and 28 mins.. Yes you read it right, film is too long but if you truely love cinema you'll never feel bored even for a second throughout entire run. The film is based on the murder of Indians during early 1920s commited by some greedy white Americans to steal their lands and since it is a real story it didn't have many twists and turns, sometimes it becomes predictable but belive me peak acting by main leads and a gripping screenplay featuring dramatic scenes with some great dialouges will keep you engaging.. I read somewhere that this film is only for older audience and will not be enjoyed by modern audience mainly because of its runtime and it'll tell you it's completely false until you are one of those new kid who only enjoys action and superhero stuff. As a 22 yr old myself I always enjoy longer drama movies since I love cinema too much I've also loved The Irishmen in 2019 and always look out for more movies like these.. Overall I loved entire second of it and if you also a cinema lover like me don't miss this one, it's nothing very special since its based on a book which was also based on real events but trio of MS, LDC and RDN made it great.. Watch it for great acting and as a solid thriller drama you'll enjoy it..",9/10,21 January 2024,marwinsingh-30063,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Read the book instead,"I was so excited to see this movie because of how captivating the book was. The film was good, but I must agree with others that it was much too long. I don't mind long movies, but I actually started to doze off at one point. Some seriously needed editing might have trimmed it down to a 2 hour 45 minute film.

In spite of its length, the movie missed some key elements. It fails to clearly demonstrate how the whole community was ""scalping"" the Osage. I don't think the viewer could understand the vastness of it in the movie. Also left out , was how much the government itself was responsible for what happened. It went from striking oil, to Hale.

I also think there should have been so much more on J Edgar Hoover's Tom White. He was the mastermind behind catching Hale, and that part was scooted over with barely any detail, along with the groundbreaking strides made by the FBI. Actually the FBI was barely even mentioned in the movie.

If you found the movie interesting, please read the book. It's actually much more shocking!

Scoresese on autopilot: too tame & repetitive,"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",5/10,20 October 2023,alex_with_a_P,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
It could've be shorter,"Let me preface my review with this: I'm a fan of history, I'm 1/2 Cherokee and Love the films of Scorcese, DiCaprio , and Dinero.

This movie I'll rate in 2 parts. The first 1 1/2 and the last 2 hrs. Part 1 a 7. Part 2 a 9. For the love love of us that still go to the movies and those that invest in them, either bring back the Intermission or trim some fat to save for the directors cut release.

Without a doubt 30-45 minutes could've been trimmed from the 1st half. It created the mood, planted seeds for the 2nd half, but definitely too long.

There were only 24 people in the theater. Half of those like myself were there alone.

I'm sure more people would view if this and other epics were shorter or there was an intermission. I'm sure the theater operators would appreciate the additional concessions revenue.",8/10,21 October 2023,cherokee013,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Yet a other brilliant movie from Scorsese,"Killers of the flower Moon was a brilliant telling of a severely over looked part of american history, the story does not stray to tell the gory and disturbing things that people did to others to gain money from oil, As always the movie may have been long but i was captivated for every minute of it, people may complain about the long silences and the 'unnecessary' close in on looks given by Ernest and other characters but really they were necessary to portray the mood of the characters.

Another role played brilliantly by DiCaprio no doubt, he does well to portray his character (ernest) He shows just how much Ernest trusted but also feared his uncle to go to the extent in which he did at his uncles will, he was even going to go to jail for the man despite realising just what he had done and how much of a fraud he was saying he 'cared' cared for the people when in reality it was him killing them off for their money and oil claims.

Overall i believe this was a very well done movie, well paced and with brilliant actors and writing, Scorsese had pulled it off again.

"7/10. Good, but not a masterpiece.","The plot is much too simple and straightforward. The screenplay is not good enough to justify the 3.5 hour length and it causes the film to feel extremely long. The run time is not earned. There is so litttle going on from moment to moment I think even if you left and came back 20 minutes later you will not have missed a thing. It is especially hard to keep track of the characters given how quickly they are introduced and killed off from scene to scene. The murders I think were glossed over much too easily, and kind of clumsily executed. There were numerous chuckles here and there through the film during my showing, and that just isn't the kind of atmosphere a movie like this should be conveying. It is supposed to make you feel horrified and uncomfortable. Not to mention the ending was abrupt and very weak. Acting was superb, and movie had an important message to tell. Overall it was serviceable, but no masterpiece.

The banality of evil,"A stunning exploration of the banality of evil centers on Ernest Burkhart, played brilliantly and powerfully by DiCaprio. Sometimes I blinked and saw not an actor, but a real criminal from black and white photographs of the century before last - limited, evil, greedy, with the face of degradation. And most importantly, he is a master at lying to himself.

This is amazing - how can you feel good while killing your wife's relatives, the mother of your children? How can you believe that you are a loving husband (he believes, that's what's amazing!) when you inject your wife with a drug that clearly makes her worse. I had a strange association that Ernest, as if under a magnifying glass, showed the same effect of a split psyche as the population of totalitarian aggressor countries, whose population also convinced and continues to convince themselves of their innocence. That evil manifested with their consent is the will of God (or the leader, or the will of the uncle) - and I am actually not a monster (approving genocide, committing bloodshed), not a murderer, I am good. I take care of my wife. I injected her with poison and then carefully combed her hair... DiCaprio and Scorsese brilliantly embodied this character. It's a banality of evil that's impossible to believe and that sucks Molly in like sticky swamp mud.

But I admit, I couldn't watch the movie without interruption. I needed a drink, a snack and just to get up. Although the direction and cinematography are beautiful and I didn't get bored, it was physically difficult for me to spend so much time sitting in front of the screen. As a book publishing editor, I know that authors are against abbreviations - they worked a lot on the text. But often the book (film) only benefits from this.",8/10,4 January 2024,tururru,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Needed 45 minutes cut. Could have been amazing!,"Essentially you can't fault anything about this movie, except the pace. The story was amazing and needing to be told , incredible cast with incredible acting , incredible director , incredible visuals but the first two acts were like not just slow but excruciating. Needed 45 minutes out and would have then become an all time classic, but who is going to tell Scorsese to get back in the edit and clean up the soggy edit ? There is so much good about this movie it's a real shame pace became such a problem. There is simply no need for it to be this long. I will rewatch, but I spent a large portion of my time in cinema looking at my watch thinking wow we have another two plus hours of this , how am I going to make it ? This comes from a HUGE Scorsese fan going in wanting to love this movie. Final act bought it together but needed to have done so much sooner . All in my humble opinion of course . The trailer shows a very different movie.

Oil's Well That Ends Well,"In ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" director Martin Scorsese takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the flower-blooming, oil-oozing fields of Oklahoma, blending historical drama with a tinge of dark humor. This isn't your typical Scorsese mob flick, but it's got enough intrigue and family betrayal to make Vito Corleone blush.

The film's opening sequence, where Osage Nation elders bury a ceremonial pipe, sets a somber tone, but don't be fooled. As we dive into the story of Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio with the usual flair but surprisingly more mustache-twirling villainy than expected, we're treated to a saga that's part history lesson, part soap opera. The narrative unfolds with the subtlety of a gusher, splashing riches and misfortune in equal measure. There's something darkly comedic about DiCaprio's earnest Ernest trying to navigate the complexities of Osage law, love, and oil - all while wearing a hat that seems to have a life of its own.

Scorsese's portrayal of William King Hale as a cowboy-hat-wearing, cattle-ranching, back-stabbing villain is so over-the-top, it's almost a caricature. Robert De Niro's Hale struts around the reservation with a swagger that screams ""I'm the bad guy,"" yet everyone seems blissfully unaware. The film's highlight is a scene where De Niro and DiCaprio discuss murder plans over a game of checkers, while casually swatting away the flies of moral conscience. The dialogue here is so on the nose, it's almost as if Scorsese is winking at the audience, saying, ""Yes, I know what I'm doing.""

But where ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" truly shines is in its portrayal of the Osage community. The film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of their exploitation and suffering, yet there's an undercurrent of resilience and dark humor in their struggle. The scenes of the Osage council plotting their comeback could give ""Game of Thrones"" a run for its money - if only they had dragons.

In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a historical epic that unexpectedly doubles as a dark comedy. It's like if ""There Will Be Blood"" met ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" at a family reunion and decided to make a movie about oil, murder, and cowboy hats. Scorsese delivers a visually stunning, narratively complex film that will make you laugh, cry, and perhaps check your insulin. Just remember, in the world of Osage oil, trust no one, especially not a man in a cowboy hat.",9/10,19 January 2024,natmavila,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),POSITIVE
Good for the history but..,"The good thing about this movie it's telling the truth about land and people which their fortune are stealing by greediness and with government approval, however the movie lacks the tension and if you like napped for half hour you won't miss anything, the movie could be one and half hour max without missing anything from the 3 and half hour.

During the movie you will always have feeling okay it's gonna be interesting here, but it will never come.

And i feel that most of people aren't thinking a bit to discover things, Molly and Ernest they can't see what's planning at all or they suspect anyone.

The acting of the Gladstone was the best part here.

Intermission would have been nice,"Keeping the theme of time....... Some people can't handle a 3-hour and 27-minute movie. However, *chefs kissed* because this is detailed storytelling. After sitting and thinking about the story for a full day, I don't think anything could have been taken out. There is a build-up to each character where you as the audience are invested in their personal story. Whether you are waiting for their demise or triumph. The acting is absolutely Oscar-worthy. Leo, Lily, and Robert owned every scene they were in and I truly hope they receive their flowers come award season.

(MOP) Yeah, the movie is long but what great movies aren't? *cough* gone with the wind *cough* End Game*. This story about Native tragedy was depicted beautifully and is one that world needs to see.

Another great director past his best...,"As a long time admirer of Martin Scorsese, this film promised so much, but apart from the running time, delivered less than the promise.

The premise of the story was good, and the acting excellent, but the pace was slow and the film could do with some judicious trimming in the editing suite. Some scenes were overlong and others such as the autopsy scene were jarring and completely unnecessary.

It seems like another recent example of a great director who has either forgotten the need to tell a tale concisely, or that has no-one around them to have a quiet word, rather than just agreeing and admiring the master.

Look forward to seeing the 'non-Directors Cut' of the film to experience what could have been.

It could have been more with less,"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.

The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.

Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.

There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.

Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",4/10,21 October 2023,jpcjcpd,Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),NEGATIVE
This is what Hollywood needs!,"This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.

Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.

Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.

Hard Not to Compare it to the Book and Feel Disappointed,"I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.

As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.

The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.

Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.

Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.

I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.

Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.

While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that ""nothing happened"" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.

Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.

But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.

Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.

Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.

Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.

I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.

I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.

The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.

""Dune: Part 2"" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.

Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the modern era.

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.

Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.

Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.

In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In ""Part 2,"" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.

I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.

While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in ""Dune: Messiah"", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.

Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.

Extremely recommended.",10/10,26 February 2024,Dvir971,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Long live the fighters,"Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.

""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.

When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.

However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.

The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.

I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.

The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.

Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.

Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.

One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.

Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.

While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.

We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.

I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.

WOW! I need Dune Messiah now.,"If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.

For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.

I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.",10/10,26 February 2024,Ellimof,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
"Beautiful production, less than perfect script","As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.

The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.

As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.

The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.

My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.

Ladies and gentleman.. the PEAK of filmmaking!!,"This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!

This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!

Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!

I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!

I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!

"A masterpiece, a pillar of sci-fi/fantasy","This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.

Arrakis is Real.,"A monumental piece of cinema.

Paced to perfection, uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking, beyond thrilling, with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding. Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring. An entire production on their A-Game.. it's an incredible technical achievement. Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special. Denis Villeneuve's love for 'Dune' shines through every stunning frame. Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful, but here he improves on it in every way. It just doesn't get better than this.

"Visual masterpiece, questionable narrative","I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.

The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.

I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment... Let's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.

What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public.. For once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it.. The movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.

Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate... The relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.

The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie... An A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.

An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.

It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.

A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.

I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again.

Epic Visuals; Steeped in complexity,"The movie picks up right where the first film left off, and while I personally go CRAZY over the direction of this film, it comes with its share of challenges.

The tops Visuals. Denis Villeneuve's vision of Arrakis is absolutely beautiful and something you would want to look at. The desert landscapes and the intricate details of the Fremen's world are portrayed with such precision and care. Every frame is so certain in its story.

Timothée as Paul Atreides, wow. Brought nuanced performance that captures Paul's every situation, struggle with perfection.

Finally, Zendaya gets more screen time as Chani (as she should). The chemistry that she and Timothee had on screen added a much-needed emotional layer to the film. The relationship felt authentic and grounded, providing a human touch amidst the grandiose setting.

The Flaws The pacing is a significant issue. At times, the movie feels like it's dragging, especially during some of the longer, more introspective scenes. These moments, while beautiful, can feel a bit too drawn out and risk losing the audience's attention. It's a film that demands patience, and not everyone will appreciate this slow-burn approach. The plot itself remains dense and complex, staying true to the novel. For fans of the book, it's a joy to see such a faithful adaptation. However, for those who aren't familiar with the source material, the story can be confusing and hard to follow. There are many characters, political factions, and subplots to keep track of, and the film doesn't always make it easy to understand what's going on. A bit more exposition or simplification could have gone a long way in making the film more accessible to a broader audience.

Another area where the film falls short is in its emotional resonance. While the performances are strong, there's a certain coldness to the story. The epic scope and the focus on political intrigue sometimes overshadow the personal, human elements. I found myself appreciating the film intellectually more than emotionally. It's a grand, impressive spectacle, but it doesn't always connect on a deeper, more personal level. The action scenes, when they come, are thrilling and well-executed. The battles are intense, and the use of practical effects combined with CGI creates a believable and immersive experience. The Sandworms, iconic to the Dune universe, are particularly well done, evoking both awe and terror. Hans Zimmer's score deserves a special mention. His music elevates the film to another level, adding a haunting, otherworldly quality that perfectly matches the tone and scale of the story. It's powerful and evocative, enhancing the impact of the visual storytelling.

In conclusion, DUNE PART 2, is a visually stunning and ambitious film that stays true to its source material. It offers strong performances, particularly from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, and creates an immersive world that is a joy to get lost in. However, its slow pacing, complex plot, and emotional detachment can make it a challenging watch. Fans of the first film and the book will likely appreciate it, but it may not resonate as strongly with a broader audience. It's a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who are willing to dive deep into its intricate world, but potentially alienating those looking for a more straightforward or emotionally engaging experience.

"I don't love it, and I wanted to.","Dune Part 2 is an epic movie; slickly made, and visually stunning.

But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book, especially the water of life scene and the final battle.

The movie had almost a 3 hour run time, but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance.

It is a beautiful movie, but it feels like it has no soul. The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.

I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.

The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.

I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.

It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",6/10,6 March 2024,hopkinsamye,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Seems like completely different writing from part 1,"The Bad

1. The dialogue is clunky and robotic with too much name use (shoutout to the live script-reading from the princess).

2. The constant exposition dumps are spoon fed to you as to ensure you can digest the baby food (unlike the first).

3. Illogical fights: attack the mining structure and lose men to launch a bazooka at the thopter and only then use your energy beam weapon that instantly destroys the giant structures? And when they beat the emperor why didn't the bene gesserits use the voice on Paul or the fremen? Why did the emperor get to choose a champion to fight Paul after all he'd done? How the hell are the fremen (at the exact same time) able to mount like 4 worms at the exact same time and use the worms to attack the harkonnens while we never see a single dismount.

4. 100% pointless scenes: ""you wanna be a fremen, walk from here to there and back."" Never shows him complete the task, never shows him being accepted as a fremen BECAUSE he accomplished it.

This movie plays like a super long episode of a poorly written tv series that's trying to cram as much from the book as possible onto the screen (again, completely unlike the first).

The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back of our generation...,"I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.

Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.

The Problem with Chani,"It was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hype.

However, for me there was a niggling itch through the movie. Something about Chani's character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressed.

I googled to see if others shared this feeling, all I could find was praise for the character. However there was consensus that she was written very different from the book.

I finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect I felt with Chani

The following is not my writing and all credit is given to Kara Kennedy - "" ...Herbert's novel Dune, Chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength, influence, and power. She becomes Paul's love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the Fremen community. She is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as Sayyadina, standing apart from Paul to oversee the cultural rites. She is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her child's Bene Gesserit grandmother, Jessica, and saves Paul from a long coma. She is wise enough to understand the political necessities of Paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contract.

Chani's attachment to Paul is an important part of the story, but it does not reduce her to being a simple, one-dimensional female character. Chani is an essential window into Fremen culture. Her multi-faceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in non-Western cultures that continue to be debated about in the real world.

Meanwhile, the films-Dune: Part One and especially Dune: Part Two-make substantial changes to Chani's character in the name of making her more independent, which end up making her more stereotypically masculine. She is mainly a fighter who has a fling with Paul. She is not a mother and not a religious figure, instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices. She is almost a second Jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with Paul.

Chani's disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary, Western, cynical view taking over the story; that religion must be purged to empower the individual, to free women from their shackles. This change in Chani's character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex, because she's not a follower and she doesn't believe. She can be dismissive of Paul and sees little to learn from him. Their relationship is then not a mutual exchange, a partnership, but something she has to turn aside from to be independent.

The underlying message is that if Chani were a woman of faith like in the book, she couldn't be an interesting, complex character, just a follower who's oppressed. The takeaway is that the Fremen's religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders. That faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches, wear headscarves, and discuss religious ideas, or who carry the tribe's ancestors in their bodies.

Chani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular West about the power of religion in the 21st century. It is possible that the idea in Dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner, drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves, is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation, especially given the book's Middle Eastern influences. If viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes, that there is division, that someone is the rational one to turn away from the 'fundamentalists,' then Chani offers this. She is the contrasting perspective, the voice of so-called reason, who questions the religious indoctrination.

But ultimately, the considerable changes made to Chani's character for Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book. Any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community. Chani's depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone.""

Hard to put into words,"As an avid movie fan I see plenty of movies, many average, many bad, a few good and once in while great. But I use the word great scarcely. Dune 2 is better than great. Oppenheimer was a great movie but I wouldn't rush back to see it a second time in the near future. Dune 2, I would see it again tomorrow. The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year? I don't think so, best movie of a generation is more akin to what I saw. Wish I could give it 11 stars.

Slightly disappointed because...,"Visually and musically stunning like the first movie with excellent action scenes. Casting superb for the most part. Aside from Walken as Emperor, which in my opinion was not a great cast. Nothing against Christopher as an actor, but he just doesn't seem all that well in that roll, but still good enough to get the job done. Also, I am not the biggest fan of Zendaya. Visually she's a good cast for Chani, but her constant angry face and little chemistry with Paul is distracting. Chalamet and Ferguson absolutely nailed the roles.

My main issues with the movie are incomplete or reduxed storytelling and that the director decided not to include possiblly some of the most important and fascinating elements and scenes, at least for me, from the story.

The werding way. I was disappointed, since the technology was available, that the directoror did not incorporate the (Bene Gesserit) werding way martial art of Paul and Jessica, where the moments were so fast that it almost appeared as teleportation. This should have been in the movie, to emphasize how incredibly skilled, mysterious and god-like Paul and Jessica would be to the fremen (and the viewer).

Jessica's reverend mother transformation was not explained properly and seriously underperformed by the writing. The explanation of the magnitude and significance of what Reverend Mother is was not construed properly in the movie. Reverend mothers were seriously overpowered beings with strong powers and influence. The fact that there was another hidden reverend mother on Dune was not signified properly. The transformation in the book was much more poignant and there was very little explanation to Jessica's daughter Aliah, and the Abomination. Jessica's role was seriously deminished in the second movie.

Kwisatz Haderach, I found the significance and explaition and the powers were inadequately explained and explored by the movie. As mentioned earlier, the significance of powers of Reverend Mothers. But it wasn't shown how much of a big deal the Kwisatz Haderach actually was and how much more powerful he was. His precience, past memories should have been more visually and nuanced.

It felt like the director was too cautious or afraid to explore the more mysterious and transcedental parts of the story, which in my opinion are the core of the story. Without it feels almost pointless and like a different plot, where Paul just fights to free the Fremen and Jessica gets a nun spiritual job with the Fremen. While Paul is shown as a gifted fighter with some sort of special abilities, that don't look all that different to anyone else. Where in fact Paul's fighting when using weirding way would almost be incompreheble to the Fremen.

In summary, the movie is a visual feast with a theatrical presence of a masterpiece, but fails capture the magnitude of the main characters and their abilities and in essence what the power struggle (not just for spice) is all about. Could have been a 10/10.

RIDICULOUS,"We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.

Paul Atreides is handled masterfully,"""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.

The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.

It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.

This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.

One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?

We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.

Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.

Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve.

Visually stunning but missing the core of the story,"Like the first part, the second part is visually stunning, though having read the book twice, I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties, De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical/mythical core of the story. This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.

Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience. A kind of secular, profane Dune. Still nice, but also a bit disappointing.

Incredible Film,"Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film.

I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras.

This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!

"Visually Stunning, Terribly Boring","The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no-one seems to really acknowledge... the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he/she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden. Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.

Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.

It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.",6/10,9 April 2024,TiredOldMan13,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Yawn....,"As a sci-fi enthusiast, I approached the latest Dune 2 movie with a sense of anticipation, hoping to be swept away by its grandeur and depth. However, what I encountered left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected. The film seemed to lack the spark that ignites the imagination, opting instead for a plodding pace that failed to engage me fully.

Perhaps it was my own weariness or a misalignment with the source material, but I struggled to find moments worth revisiting after the credits rolled. The supposed ""best scenes"" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.

While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.

In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.",5/10,9 April 2024,Reticent_Reviewer,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Absolutely stunning,"I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. ""You fought well Atreides.""

Excellent Visuals but Overly Condensed,"This movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades. The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.

That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.

Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does. Its legs are long and slender, with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand, but it stands nonethelss :)

Denis Villeneuve is a modern sorcerer in Sci-Fi!,"Dune: Part Two is simply Denis Villeneuve's Magnum Opus in his filmography. I've loved this director's work since ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""Arrival"". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!

The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!

There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!

Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired! There's so much to take away from this masterpiece! Definitely my #1 favorite movie of this year as of now! Bring on Dune: Part Three as fast as possible!",10/10,26 February 2024,elijahbutler-40119,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Denis Villeneuve Promises and Delivers,"This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",10/10,26 February 2024,guslopes-75373,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Under A Black Sun,"Here I'll conflate both of Villeneuve's Dunes within one critic: It is a slow, wide, deep and bare opus, best viewed on the biggest possible screen and sound system, in typical Villeneuve fashion.

I didn't read the books but I saw the 1984 movie, and Villeneuve's version is built to become a classic, even if less spectacular or outrageous. What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.

Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.

On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars.",8/10,30 May 2024,MVictorPjinsiste,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Visually Pretty.......But,"This movie has the same problems as part one. The editing in this is terrible! Scenes don't connect, they start an assignment or story branch, then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests. No idea is complete, nothing gets resolved, and the dialogue is horrendous.

These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow. If you haven't read the books you won't understand anything that's happening here. What we have here is a movie that is really pretty. It maxes out in the visuals category. The sound was hit or miss, but the plot, pacing and characters were all bad.

Not a masterpiece. Sorry.

Truly a masterpiece,"After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting.

The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow.

The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.

It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.

The hype is not real,"From the time this movie has been released it has been described as one of the best sequal ever made,but I feel bad to say this; it's not.

It is still a good movie but it is inferior to the first part.

I haven't read the books and when i watched the first part it was so entertaining and when you know a director like Denis Villeneuev will also make the next part,your expectations increases multiple times.

I can understand they have a book and they are making it according to the source material but still you don't feel that amazement or thrill like the first movie.

For me the biggest reason is not hiring the writer of the first movie Eric Roth.

He is a damn good writer and has written movies like Forrest gump,The curious case of Benjamin button and etc.

I don't know the reason why he wasn't there for this movie. But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.

They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.

It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.

I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.

Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.

You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.

But as we know it would never come out.

Rest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.

You will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.

Let's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.

I believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make.",6/10,17 April 2024,Cinephilia1508,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
"Trying to be more than it is, but lacked.","This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie. Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.

"Great, but definitely not a masterpiece.","I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it's as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.

Enough good things have already been said about this movie, so I'll just point out the negatives:

1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.

2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.

3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.

4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.

Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.",8/10,4 March 2024,maximumsid,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
"A movie of epic proportions, everything I'd hoped for.","Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.

I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.

In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.

We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.

A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.

I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.

The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.

Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.

I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.

Snooze fest,"If this movie wasn't 3 hours long... if it were say, 2 hours, I'd probably give it a solid 8. A lot went into this film. And I could write a review full of things I liked. But given all the 10 of 10 ratings (making it possibly the most overrated Hollywood film this century) I just have to state the minuses.

Dune: part 2 was full of long dialogue heavy scenes and too many characters and too much ""worship"" of Timothée Chalamet's character Paul. We get it.. he's the ""chosen one."" It just came off as cliché. And Zendaya is cool, but she's not the caliber of actor that can hold a movie for 3 hours. She had RBF the entire movie.

Also the build up to the bad guys dying over the last two films was a big let down. The ""uncle"" character (Baron) was awful for 2 films and he gets killed in 2 seconds. Same with his ""nephew"" (Glossu). All this time spent with them and they just fall over and die. And Christopher Walken was terribly miscast in this as the emperor. Weak character.

And the sandworms. They were cool the first 5 times. But for the amount of screen time they get and they never change... it gets old after awhile.

It's a good film to revisit to fall asleep too. But it other than a cool soundtrack and some great cinematography and costume design, this film doesn't really do much. Dune has proven a very difficult story to capture on film and no one has done it right yet.

It's really good. But not convinced by some of the cast.,"I couldn't see Christopher Walken as embodying a character in this. I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.

And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.

Also the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a two-part movie. I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.

Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length. Lots of good cinematography, music, etc.",8/10,29 February 2024,Otkon,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
I have never done this before,"Movie is so good that I went back to theater next day for watch it again. I have never done this before, I have never watched any movie twice in theater.

I just couldn't get enough of this film and it feels like I need to go watch it 3rd time. Visuals and sounds are stunning, cast is so good that I can't ask any better performance. The whole dune universe is magical, intriguing, captivating and thrilling. If you are fan of science fictions and good lore with deep detailed story behind it. This movie is a love letter for you.

Absolutely AMAZING film!! This is my all time number 1 movie I have ever seen in my 40 years old age on this planet.

Star Wars of the 2020's,"I had the joy of watching this movie early, and was nothing short of amazed. Simply put this movie is one of the best crafted, and most impressive films I have ever seen. The casting is spectacular, and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well. The camera angles are creative and unique, showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways (even surpassing the quality of Dune part One). This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit through a three hour long movie.

A Masterpiece,"Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.

With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.

The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.

See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed.",10/10,2 March 2024,Jason24321,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Am I the only one who's not seeing it?,"I mean, yeah, it's very entertaining and, of course, very visually stunning. The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!

But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.

None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.

I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books.",7/10,2 March 2024,Sakaresm,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Great adaptian of the first book (but not perfect),"I just watched the pre-premiere of part two of Dune. It was a very good adaption of the books but not what totally what I expected. At the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest. Especially the part (which is very important in the book-storyline) is the fact that the sister of Paul wasn't born yet when the film came to it's conclusion. Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film. Still I strongly recommend to watch it... it is a must-see movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already.

"Visually stunning, but emotionally flat","I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen.

Though I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Paul and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen.

Austin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance.

And here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time.",7/10,16 March 2024,thejefflewis-92228,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
can't take the heat don't walk in the kitchen,"First of all, part one was pretty good, fast pace some talking , but not much, a fast pace movie I enjoyed, overall a very good movie.

The overall part 2 is boring not the actors fault though, rather it's the script that is dragging its feet nowhere because it's badly written so bad it becomes a snooze, at the end of the day it's boring and we've lost interest. Characters spend some much time talking philosophizing whining and complaining you wonder why a production would spend millions on such a badly written boring story. That's the trend these days, when a network wants to cut down expenses it's making characters blob to death.

Chalamet not my cup of tea in this part 2, he looks out of place, feels more like a choir boy rather than an action movie hero.

Part 2 misses the mark.",5/10,8 April 2024,gsboy1000000,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Deviates too much from the book,"It is probably impossible to create a good Dune movie, as the book(s) are really complex in many ways. With that said, the first movie captured the essence of Dune as well as you could and kept true to the plot for the most part.

This second movie, however, kills some characters and dynamics. Why is Stilgar only a comedic relief? Why did they decide to leave Alia, one of the most important characters in the books, out of the movie? Why is the relationship between Chani and Paul so shallow? They even left out that they had a son that died. The ending scene is underwhelming and is not in line with Paul from the books.

If you're willing to ignore these issues, or you have never read the books at all, this is still a GREAT movie, but the authentic Dune experience still remains Frank Herbert's book.

The average cinemaphile...,"The true beauty of Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune' films is that if you haven't read the books (which most viewers haven't) - you still get a true sense of the scope of the material.

It's epic - massive. And it's on full display in these gorgeous films. Tragedy, horror and honor.

The director and writers have done a great service to us all...

These are incredible films - films that this ignorant generation, who undoubtebly have no idea of its importance claim their own. Defining an era. Much like Star Wars did in the 70's. This will set the standard. All epic films from this point forward will be judged accordingly...

Better than the previous film.,"I was only mildly impressed with ""Dune"" (2021). It was a HUGE improvement over David Lynch's 1980s version, that's for sure. But it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities. It was big...but also a bit disappointing despite this bigness. Fortunately, this second film, while also slow, is a bit more interesting to watch and it's battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen. And, fortunately, it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting. While not a perfect version of the second portion of the Frank Herbert book, it is very good and well worth seeing.

My only regrets about the film were minimal. First, the worm scenes were far less interesting than I'd hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground. Also, I had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swords...in a sci-fi epic?! So many swords...when a machine gun or tank would have been so much better! Still, these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your time.

I might say more but there are well over 2000 reviews. So, 'nuff said.",9/10,25 May 2024,planktonrules,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
"Great, but not better than Dune part 1.","Great movies should always leave you with a feeling during or after seeing them.

While this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece by many, I felt that it didn't give me the feeling of chills that Dune part 1 made feel multiple times.

Those who say that it is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made should be arrested at once.

This movie had all the ingredients to actually be a modern day masterpiece but it feels like Dennis was a bit restraint to go all the way, as if he could not dare to be free and do things he could have done with the story and action.

That being said, Dune part 2 is an amazing movie and I will see it again.

However. While I've seen the part 1 more than 6 times, I don't think part 2 will have that effect on me.

Dune Two! Excellent follow up to part one,"Tightly written, well acted focused Saga story! The writing is without a wasted scene. The acting fulfills the purpose of the story. While none of the actors will win any acting awards, the overall product makes this lengthy movie, flyby and leave you wanting more. Well done!

The story succeeds, despite the fact that the characters are functionaries in the goal of the story. None of them are well drawn and multidimensional. Apart from this, the nuance of the purpose of the story drives you in and makes you care about them.

There is satisfaction when the evil people get there just desserts. You feel great when characters are reunited. You feel sorrow when there are emotional defeats. ""Feel"" is the main message here. The spectacle delivers.

A Cinematic Triumph,"""Dune: Part Two"" (2024), directed by the masterful Denis Villeneuve, stands as a remarkable sequel that not only lives up to but surpasses its predecessor. Much like the celebrated sequels ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2003), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), this film elevates the franchise to new heights.

Villeneuve's atmospheric and deliberately paced direction, complemented by Hans Zimmer's enigmatic score, creates an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning. The vast, sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giant-worm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape, leaving audiences mesmerized throughout.

The introduction of Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence, while the demise of the Harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate, avoiding simplicity. The film culminates in an epic duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha, delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusion.

Timothée Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides, the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen. The narrative remains faithful to Frank Herbert's novel, capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that ""the war has just begun.""

While the novel doesn't extend to a Part Three, the expansive universe of Dune offers numerous sequels in the books. With the right efforts and approvals, there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future. For now, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen, and I eagerly anticipate experiencing it again, this time with my beloved by my side.",10/10,28 May 2024,haabub,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Pacing killed it,"I haven't seen the first Chalamet Dune, but I have seen the David Lynch one and personally think it's so much better. I think the cinematography was beautiful in DPT, the acting was great, the accuracy to the books... but I was so bored. It makes me wonder what the goal of making these movies (besides money, duh) was; a modern interpretation of Dune? A deep dive into the character dynamics? A story that would be better appreciated with improved CGI? Beats me.

My opinion might be controversial, but despite being a well-made movie, I just don't think it's that remarkable. Lynch's Dune was bizarre, had that beloved retro sci-fi vibe, WAY more memorable character designs, and just left more of an impression on me. Accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic, but unless the author is making the movie themself, why expect perfect duplication?

My recommendation: unless you're a die-hard Dune fan, you can definitely skip this one.",6/10,11 April 2024,cb_whitewood,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
"Worth watching, not praising","Before you call Dune Part II 'the best Sci-fi movie' or even just a 'masterpiece' try and consider the 5 bullet points I've made below - you might even end up agreeing with some of them ;)

Beforhand let me just point out that the movie was extraordinary beautifully filmed with goosebumpy music added to a dozen of memorable shots, hence the good rating. So yeah, it is a great movie with great acting. It's actually a really good movie. But that has been pointed out by a LOT of people already. Let me tell why this isn't in the 10/10 league.

1. The major problem: Pacing. 2 parts of the movie, which could have been legendary, ended up being rushed: The battle of the Sardaukar and Fremen and Paul's first time riding the Worm-metro.

You don't have to be a criticizer of the movie to admit, that the last fight with Fremen and Sardaukar was so shy of what it could have been. The fremen just sweeps away the emperor's army (I mean come on) in around 10 minutes of screentime. This is what the whole movie leads up to. 10 minutes. And not 10 nail-bittering minutes with an epic battle. Just 10 minutes of one side slaughtering the other. I get that they took them by surprise, but please. It would have added film value to get a tense fight, where you actually wonder whether or not they will succeed. Instead of getting a edge-of-your-seat moment, we got the predictable outcome. It feels like Denis was told to compress the last 1/3 of the film - making it as anticlimactic as possible.

The sandworm-ride did make a good scene, but you don't actually see any training whatsoever. So instead of getting psyched up by him succeeding, you end up thinking; could he do this all the time?

2. Paul's metamorphose to become the chosen one - or rather the absence of it. Why can't this guy admit that there might be something to the prophecy. I get that his humility is what makes him adequate for the part, but because of his continuing denial of the prophecy, we as audience too lose faith in him as the Kwisatz Haderach. Which, just like the incident of him learning to sandworm-ride, makes an unfulfilling, anticlimactic and awkward transition.

3. The weak villains. I was expecting a lot from the villain-side, after Dune 1 where the emperor and baron felt clever and sly. Feyd had a great portrayal in the movie though, but the rest of them seemed frivolous. Seriously, how did the emperor manage to keep his throne for that long, with an army, that with a little surprise, breaks like glass. And Rabban is apparently just a joke despite him actually being sort of scary in Dune 1.

In general the Harkonnens seem off by a lot! They get toyed around on multiple occasions, and we in the audience never actually see them as a threat due to their weak portrayal. (We mostly see them kill poor employees)

4. Chani and Paul had zero romance. Sorry, but it's true. I want to see them as this meant-to-be couple, but we literally only see them bonding a couple of times. I made the assumption that Chani must be bi-polar; the girl is crazy careful and suspicious of other people several times in the movie, but starts a relationship with Paul based on 2-3 scenes with interaction. People on Tinder tend to talk more with each other before jumping into bed than these two.

5. The political aspect - or once again the absence of the same. We hear about these other houses as dangerous and powerful, but where are they? As a viewer who hasn't read the books, I do not have the slightest idea of what these other houses are capable of. This is probably the main reason of the incomplexity of the plot. We don't any political reflections or responses, despite the fact that it must mean a great deal! Without the tangled political game (which I guess is pretty damn important in a world run by houses) the plot becomes predictable on a level which compares to most superhero-movies.

Imagine that we had seen the other houses and their beautiful planets. Now THAT would be sci-fi in its glory!!

Consider that I had so much against the storytelling (which is the fundamental part of a film) yet still gave it 8/10. I'm surely also going to see it in theaters at least one more time. That goes to show how brilliant the cinematography actually was! Worth watching, not praising.

I wish it was better,"I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.

Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.

I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the ""twist"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",6/10,5 March 2024,movies_are_life_,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Ministry of Silly Desert Walks. Dune Part 2 is boring.,"So look, Dune Part 1 by Denis Vilneuve was pretty decent. I'd give that one a 7ish. But part 2 was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movie.

Everyone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces. It's really drab... And in the end I really didn't care about any of the characters. It was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deep.

The music is faux epic and sadly doesn't lend any particular weight to what's ultimately a decent story told in a very boring way.

I'd say the VFX is good - yeah... not bad. But the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring - like going through the motions.

The film has a few good moments, but an epic sci-fi masterpiece of our time this film is not. The silly desert walks are pretty funny though! XD haha.",3/10,11 April 2024,interastral,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Masterclass in grand spectacle,"I have said that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Dune: Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer.

Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism.

The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot.

A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging.

A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards.

P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year!

P.s.s. Can I make ""ride the worm"" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty?

This is a clear early 2025 Oscar candidate for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Score.

"100/10, DV is a genius.","Honestly, this is the first time I went to watch a movie 3 times in theaters, and I don't regret any time I went to see this movie. It's jist so beautifully put together, words cannot describe how I feel about this movie. You feel everything in this movie, sad, satisfied or excited and even more. Throughout this movie, DV unlocked the feeling of goosebumps and crying for the people who didn't experience this when watching a movie. That speech and ending had me have insane amount of goosebumps and tears. Especially with that Hans Zimmer score, it's one of the best scores in movies ever. It's Hans's best work so far. I feel like each song stuck to a title, being 'Desert Spring'. I felt goosebumps with any score. This movie showed how you introduce a villain, you do not go just saying, ""Oh No! A new threat is coming! I need to get Superman to get him!"".

You should definitely go to an IMAX/ Dolby cinema to go watch this. You can see how DV made this especially for IMAX, with the whole movie being shot with IMAX digital cameras. The cinematography done in this is excellent, acting done was also incredible with Timothee Chalamet and Javier Bardem. Zendaya on the other hand can feel a little bit weird as in the book she wasn't this rebel but I can understand how DV makes Zendaya like this because Frank Herbert wanted Paul to be an anti-hero but changing the script a bit can fully convey the message of Paul being an anti-hero.

Overall, I want to watch this again as soon as it comes back in IMAX for the third time, but I will look for IMAX GT, to get the full immersive experience of IMAX, I do not want to watch this online because the immersive experience of Dune will be gone as the screen is just too small, even though I have DTS sound system at home. This makes Star Wars sequels look like trash. I hope DV will make Messiah be even better and try and make Alia look like an 'abomination'.

When it was over I didn't know what to say,"I cried the last few minutes of pure explosion of stimuli. Cinema understanding the spectacle as few filmmakers understand today. A film that I have to process to begin trying to break down but that at first impression I simply have to surrender to that confession that it captivated me through the senses to the point of tears, as I would expect from this type of cinema; which in the last 10 years has fallen and there is no bottom to its decline. I was captured by the sound, by the most crystalline screen I have ever experienced, and since the guttural sound of the opening shook my stomach, I didn't think about anything else for almost 3 hours. I was not a child enjoying it, I was an adult surrendering to the experience. One that I assure you, was a first. 31 years of theaters and Dune 2 made me feel like the first time again.

The perfect sequel. Enchanting.,"Denis Villeneuve obviously takes Dune very seriously. As it peaks up right where Part One left off, we remain with 1.5 acts that's left of what I refer to as the Dune Duo. A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.

Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.

Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped.

Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.",10/10,26 February 2024,Orr971,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
A Cultural Phenomena,"Well, it certainly seems that this film has produced a whole array of memes within the couple of weeks since it was released in the cinemas. It is almost as if this film has quickly become a cultural phenomena. Like, it's a pretty good film, even if only because of the cinematography, which was absolutely fantastic. Though, having grown up on a steady diet of Lynch's version, I do find myself always comparing this film with that one (I have read the book, but it was ages ago). It also means that I'm pretty familiar with the story.

The problem is that there were a number of divergences from the book. For instance, it appears that the time that the events take place have been compressed from three years to one, which means that Alia isn't born (which also means that she doesn't kill the Baron either). Then there is the whole thing about there being two factions, one that is secular and one that is fanatical, and it turns out that Chani is from the secular one, which leads to an interesting ending.

Then again, I suspect that the creators assume that most of the audience don't actually know the story. Like, I'm only familiar with it up to the end of the first book, but the film did end on a cliff-hanger, suggesting that there is more to come (something that didn't seem to be the case with the Lynch version - though there is another version that also includes Dune Messiah and Children of Dune).

As I mentioned, it was a pretty good film, especially the cinematography - that was amazing. However, my main gripe would be that it felt as if the film ended a bit too quickly, which I have to say is odd for a film that happens to be two and a half hours long. Actually, that was even more strange considering that the battle in the first film seemed to take up half of the film, so I was expecting that the battle here would take about as much time, though it didn't. Also, there didn't seem to be much mention of the wierding way (though it wasn't ignored, it was just that Lynch changed it in his film because I didn't want to do kung-fu on sand dunes).

Anyway, yeah, it's certainly worth watching, and despite it being a pretty long film, it did keep me hooked right through to the end.

A beautifully shot (Denis Villeneuve never fails in this department) space opera that could have been better if its storytelling didn't edit or left out important details.,"Denis Villeneuve never fails to amaze on how beautiful his movies look. And this one is no exception.

Of course it has more action than the first one cause is the full on development of the (anti) hero's journey of Paul ""Muad'dib"" Atreides. Therefore, it showcases more depth and details, plus good plot twists, that justifies the journey and conflict.

But also, by having more storylines, the pace and edition style feels rushed in some moments. The storytelling with its half-explained moments and all of a sudden time jumps doesn't gives the same fluidity that the first one had.

There are several backstories that needed more buildup or evidence to be believable, or else, less cutting out details from the book (even though that means longer movies and more fast & furious type of movie fans complaining about ""way too long"" movies).

Of course, the ending is grandiloquent as a space opera like Dune should be. But the first two acts of the movie could have been better. Not in its photography, music or overall production value (which are amazing), just in the telling of a story that evidently has a lot of branches that needed more room to grow.",8/10,1 June 2024,ignacioazurdiacr,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
"Strong technically, weak in plot, character and dialogue","Denis Villeneuve's DUNE: PART TWO is a review-proof film. Either you watched - and loved - the first part, in which case you have already gone out and seen it. Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.

If you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.

Reason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievement

Reason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.

Caught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.

Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are ""just fine"", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.

Thank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.

Only Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.

Come to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.

Letter Grade: B

7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7/10,23 March 2024,bankofmarquis,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
A great example of why the theatre must never die!,"This is a fantastic film. To me, it was almost perfect! Acting is fantastic and the visuals are out-of-this-world. I was enthralled throughout my whole time in the cinema. I happily saw it twice and wish I'd taken the time to see it a third time as I never saw it in IMAX. It was the best cinema experience I've ever had and I fully believe that you will love it too.

If anyone else enjoys Timothee Chalamet's acting, I would also recommend The King (2019). He was great in that as Henry V and I'm sure his performance contributed to his casting in Dune (2021).

However, I can see why some people were frustrated by the plot. Having never read the book, I don't know the full extent of the changes but I do understand that it was deemed ""unfilmable"" back in 1984 when the first attempt was released. (Which reminds me a bit of a serious take on Flash Gordon or something.) Anyway, this (as well as Part 1) are very streamlined. It feels fast-paced and eventful. Which I really enjoyed as I didn't need everything. The world-building was enough but, if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, this might not be what you are looking for. I don't know.

I guess one issue I had was that the discussion of Paul as the Lisan-Al-Gaib reminded me of the discussion of Brian as the Messiah in Life of Brian. Which I personally found to be hilarious, and it felt like a deliberate homage as the actors seemed to find it funny when they were speaking the lines, but it did take me out of the story a little when I watched it at home.

Finally, when I saw this at home on the ""small screen"" I really enjoyed it. However, it was simply not the same. All of the visuals were limited by comparison and while I refer to it as the ""small screen"" this was on a relatively large screen. (I own a projector that was probably projecting somewhere around 80"").

As a result, while I will advise that you see this film in any format that is available to you but (if you can) keep an eye on any cinema / IMAX re-releases. You will not regret it. It was simply amazing on the big screen.

Saying this, it is still my favourite film of 2024 by far!

What are the fanatics on about?,"This movie is visually well done, for 80% of it shot in the bright sun of a desert. The sound is also great, but I wouldn't call it music so much as tones. It fits though. More like something seen in a t.v. Show then the epic music that Danny Elfman or John Williams bring.

The writers really didn't read the books, did they? Like the first film but even worse, this was a child's Cliff Notes version of the actually books. To know the storyline you'd have to have read the books or watched the previous, superior versions. Chani is especially poorly done and again the characters are mostly just long gazes.

I understand the simpletons who enjoyed the visuals. This movie has made a good deal of money but there's a reason it won't ever reach a billion mark like truly epic films. And the IMDB meter on this will probably drop closer to my score as non-fanatics see this film over the coming years. Again, the 3-part Frank Herbert miniseries is the best, the 1984 is the classic nostalgia and this one looks pretty but says very little.",6/10,18 April 2024,joelwillems,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Anyone who says Dune: Part 1 or 2 are good movies is lying.,"Both films are pretty consistent in the sense of, they both look amazing. The sound and score is top tier (Hans Zimmer). The action sequences ARE good when they actually happen (which is not very often.) The actors are all good actors. But they're both just straight up boring films to the core.

I don't understand how people write reviews calling it 'masterpiece' or 'the peak of film making.' I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.

It just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past. Or they're just Timothy Chalamet groupies (I'm a big fan of him as an actor in his other work) and just want him to do well. I refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good (thus making it entertaining) and it's not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like Mad Max Fury Road did. Can anyone think of any other reasons why people would really rate this movie even close to a 10/10?",3/10,5 April 2024,bcarterstone,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Anomaly!,"""Dune: Part 1"" and ""Dune: Part 2"" are films that define what sci-fi should be - an epic with a grand scale and an incredible story.

I love Herbert's novel and until Villeneuve's films, I believed that this was the type of story that could not be translated into a picture. Jesus, how wrong I was! It's an absolute masterpiece and something that lives in you. Some may be turned off by the fact that the entire film is based mainly on dialogues and building relationships, but I am sure that for those few, including myself, it will be a masterpiece on par with Star Wars for our fathers. This is what genre cinema should look like, not robots saving the galaxy and women in tight leggings jumping on buildings (yes, I'm talking about you Marvel)

The best movie I've seen in many, many, many years :)

More cinema like this please!,"A real movie captivates through compelling storytelling, strong character development, and immersive visuals and sound. It transcends mere entertainment to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and resonate with audiences on a deeper level.

Modern viewers seek originality, relatability, and escapism. ""Dune: Part Two"" is highly anticipated because it promises a continuation of an epic saga with rich world-building, intricate plots, and high production values, fulfilling the desire for both spectacle and meaningful content.

"A Cinematic Triumph of Love, Intrigue, and Stunning Visuals","""Dune: Part Two"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic saga, deserving a perfect 10/10 for its intricate storytelling, breathtaking visual effects, and the depth of its political and romantic subplots.

One of the most captivating elements of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the love story between Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya). Their relationship is developed with a genuine emotional depth that enhances the film's narrative. The chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya is palpable, adding a layer of warmth and humanity amidst the grandiose and often harsh environment of Arrakis. Their love story is not just a subplot but a driving force that shapes their characters' motivations and decisions, making the audience deeply invested in their journey.

The exploration of different factions and space politics is another area where ""Dune: Part Two"" excels. Denis Villeneuve masterfully delves into the complex political landscape of the Dune universe, where alliances are fragile, and power struggles are constant. The depiction of the various factions, including the noble House Atreides, the sinister House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic Bene Gesserit, is detailed and compelling. Each faction's distinct motivations and strategies are intricately woven into the plot, creating a rich tapestry of intrigue and conflict.

The film's visual effects continue to be a standout feature, with the same level of artistry and attention to detail that made the first installment so visually stunning. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with breathtaking realism, and the depiction of the space battles and the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes immerse the audience in this vast and detailed universe.

Villeneuve's direction ensures that every frame serves the story, balancing grand epic moments with intimate character-driven scenes. The pacing of the film is expertly managed, with each scene building on the previous one to create a crescendo of tension and excitement. The fight scenes are choreographed with precision, making them feel both brutal and graceful, and the strategic battles highlight the tactical brilliance of the characters involved.

The performances are uniformly excellent. Timothée Chalamet continues to impress as Paul Atreides, capturing the complexity of a young man burdened with immense destiny. Zendaya brings strength and sensitivity to her role as Chani, while the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Stellan Skarsgård, deliver powerful performances that add depth to the narrative.

In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of the saga, blending a captivating love story with intricate political intrigue and stunning visual effects. It not only meets but exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessor, making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. This film cements the Dune series as a landmark in cinematic history and deserves a perfect 10/10.",10/10,14 July 2024,RubenKelevra,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Dune: Part Two 2024,"Dune Part Two is a film by Denis Villeneuve from 2024.

DUNE: PART TWO"" tells the story of the mythical journey of Paul Atreides, who, with the help of Chani and the Fremen, embarks on a campaign of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Young Paul is faced with the choice between the love of his life and the fate of the entire universe. But he must try by all means to prevent a terrible future - a future that no one but him can foresee.

Denis Villeneuve returns with extremely impressive images: ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental film that largely rejects the usual blockbuster spectacle and instead reflects almost contemplatively on power and domination. This long-awaited film is therefore a multi-layered commentary on our (geopolitical) present, in which the voices of reason are hardly heard anymore. Villeneuve leads us to a dead end, or rather: we suddenly slide into an abyss - and it is no longer so easy to determine how this could have happened.

"Thw first 2/3 amazing, the last 3rd disappointing","The ending really ruined the film for me. The strong love and relation between Paul and Chani is lost, love which is very clearly seen in the whole first 3 books. Giving Chani a bigger role was ok but not at the expense of breaking the love between them. Having read the first book a few times and having seen the 80's movie and 90's TV series I will only say this: it ruined the whole movie for me.

I did expect some changes and different artistic views but this was way too much.

Except one time where was Paul's Bene Gesserit training in the whole movie??? Which by the way helped him overcome a lot in his journey.

10/10,"Dune: Part 2"" is an exceptional continuation of the epic saga that left audiences eagerly anticipating more. From the very start, the film captivates with its breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling, transporting viewers to the mystical and dangerous world of Arrakis.

The plot is filled with intense moments and unexpected twists, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The character development is deep and compelling, with performances that bring depth and nuance to the iconic figures of the Dune universe.

Disappointing Compared to Part One,"I really liked Dune Part One. So much so I saw it three times in the theater and twice streaming. I was really looking forward to Part Two. Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me.

I felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening.

And then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One.

And oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre.

Don't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch. I just think Part One is measurably better.",7/10,16 March 2024,arfdawg-1,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
It's an experience,"Just got out of the early access screening, and all I can say is wow. Truly blew my mind, from start to finish, the film keeps the foot on the gas peddle and doesn't allow you to breath even for a second.

The arena has got to be one of my favourite scenes in any movie, the cinematography, colour, score and performance by Butler is truly a sight to behold.

Outstanding performances by Timothe and Butler, with Timothe showing his range throughout the course of the movie, morphing into the thing he tries to avoid the most, and Butler playing the psychopath amazingly well. One you want to see in IMAX, memorable experience.

"People need to calm down, the movie is not that good","Dune part two is definitely an entertaining movie, but as it stands as an 8.8, lets dial it back a bit. The movie itself visually is a masterpiece, but my problem stems from character development and plot rushing. To me it seems like the last half of the movie was supposed to be 3 hours long itself but the whole movie itself was cut under 3 hours. The climactic finish to the film was super fast and felt like the stakes were low because it just went from one thing to the next with no time to breathe. Also Pauls attraites or how ever you spell it, his character pulls a game of thrones esque queem of dragons vibe, where there goals and personality are one thing then dramatically shift seemingly out of no where. Overall it was a good film, a bit long for my taste, but Its worth a watch if you like sci fi.

Sound and fury,"You would expect a dramatization of this calibre to paint a picture with all the colors of the original story - the ambient backstory of an interstellar empire, the role of the Spice as the only way to traverse the vast space between the planets, the intricate politics around the control of it, the infinite double helix of plans within plans, the clash of civilizations and prophecies, the mutual development of the characters within the story, the specter of philosophies and their cradles.

Well, If you did, you were dead wrong.

All you get is some sturm-und-drang CGI, somewhat fancy panoramas backed by the same old, supposedly, dramatic third-grade Middle Eastern-ish cheesy flute-chants, Fashion Channel panning shots of models in unnatural poses and, well, no and. That's about it.

The acting is pathetic, for the most part. An otherwise fantastic cast of legendary actors were put to reciting stiff dialogue, barely hiding their confusion.

Very good follow up but not the all time classic some are saying,"IMAX is definitely the way to see this. It's a big, loud, more action-focused installment. I loved part one and was so excited for this that I couldn't help but be disappointed by multiple aspects:

-The editing was jarring at times. A scene would suddenly end and the next scene is a completely different setting, apparently at some future (but unknown) date. This occurs multiple times.

-The Baron (and to a lessor extent Rabban) are dramatically reduced as characters in Part 2. I know he was poisoned, but the Baron was a terrifying figure in Part 1 and is barely even a threat in Part 2. Austin Butler is great, but he's hardly in the movie.

-All the talk of Messiah and Holy War are repeated many times, but I was never sold on it. Paul's refusal to venture south for so long felt more annoying than earned. I'm sure the book does a much better job, but this is the movie. Also, I couldn't help but laugh every time Jessica said her daughter (a fetus) was asking questions.

Everything else was great. It's a true epic. I'm Just one of the few that slightly preferred part one.

One for the generation.,"There are a few films that define the time. I had Star Wars trilogy as a kid, my first son had LOTR, the second had Harry Potter... and then for while it seemed like we were left with unending marvel tripe, embarrassing butchering of Star Wars franchise and shallow remakes of, well... everything.

And now, finally, I can say that my third son has a movie for his generation. Beautiful, complex, thought-provoking and epic. The movie that can extend his world into a fantasy realm that's not about wearing latex and shooting everything that moves. It's movie where nuance is discovered through many conversations with friends and lessons learned through experiencing the real world with the new lens.

Amazing.

Better than the first,"This movie grabs you by the throat from the very first and keeps you engaged throughout. The visuals are stunning and there is finally a little (I mean a little) more time spent developing plot lines in a more digestible format. In the first Dune, characters appeared and disappeared so quickly that you really didn't care what happened to them. Dune 2 is very long, but I guess that's a given with such a dense story.

What is missing is any true connection made with the characters. There is no exploration of Paul's inner thoughts or struggles or conflicts, he's just always the hero. The love story doesn't develop, it just happens, and Zendaya basically just scowls or looks confused throughout the movie. Also, there is so much crammed into the movie that there were plot leaps that weren't fully explained, so that diminishes your full investment, you just let the visuals and spectacle roll over you. To be a successful movie doesn't mean that every book element needs to be included; editing would have created a more well-rounded and emotionally impactful flick.

I do recommend, as a spectacle and fascinating other world creation. But great it is not in other aspects.",8/10,26 May 2024,fmdead,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
BEYOND,"*NON-SPOILER REVIEW*

Wow! This is just beyond. Beyond my imagination. Beyond what I was expecting. Beyond all previous iterations of this story put to film. Such an epic! Can't wait for more of this Saga 😊😉

I was quite surprised they didn't do a weird time jump. I loved the fan intro before the film and they called it a saga, so...I'm expecting they are making more, but I heard recently, this is the last Dune film from this director sadly. I hope they take this like they did Harry Potter and keep the same style and fluidity.

This film definitely had more action that the first film. They got up close and in person with it, which worked really well.

Great character development which wasn't rushed. The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.

Cinematography was epic like the previous film 🎥

Acting was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.

The whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.

The ""Narrating"" was done properly and not distracting.

I'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.

P. S.> Even though it was a long film, I didn't see one person get up to go to the bathroom. There was always something on screen worth watching.

I might buy the Dune popcorn bucket...,"Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah.

Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance.

The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica.

Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies.

The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand.

I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top.

Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.",9/10,26 February 2024,reaganreviews,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Masterpiece,"For one of the many book readers, all I have to say is WOW! I've read a lot of books that utterly fail in adapting the book but Denis adapts Dune perfectly. This is a sci-fi epic masterpiece. I know people who have not read the book and they are absolutely in love with Part 2. What makes apart 2 so amazing is how great of a job Denis did with Part 1. The perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a Messiah. Chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world. Please go see Part 2 as quickly as possible and in IMAX. This movie deserves to go down as one of, if not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. IMAX IMAX IMAX.

A Spectacle Indeed-But Story/Characters Lag Behind Predecessor,"Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.

For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded ""locally"" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.

There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.

Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:

-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just ""gives in""?

-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?

-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?

-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.

I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a ""setting up a franchise"" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.

So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune).

A Cinematic wonder.,"Dune 2 is a cinematic wonder to the world. It has a perfect way just like dune 1 to show worlds without to any color and yet show so much color at the same time. Now the holy war begins.

This is my humble opinion expresses trough AI.

""Dune 2"" is a cinematic marvel that captivates with stunning visuals and a gripping story. Like the first movie, it shows vast, barren worlds that seem colorless but are filled with vivid details. The film dives into the holy war, raising the stakes and intensity. Each scene is beautifully crafted, pulling viewers into the epic saga. The performances are strong, the music is haunting, and the direction is visionary. ""Dune 2"" not only meets the high expectations set by the first film but also expands the universe in exciting and profound ways.

I didn't like it very much,"First of all, too many changes from the book in my opinion. The characters felt a bit off. I loved much of the visuals in the film, I like the world they created, felt in line with the book and I liked the choices for the actors portraying Harkonnens especially, however, the emperor just bothered me, I thought it was such a horrible choice, just terrible, otherwise a decent cast overall that fits with the descriptions of the characters.

There were many scenes added that were not in the book and some characters were entirely removed. They were not necessarily bad if you didn't read the book, like the killing of the baron, it worked, but I couldn't help but think about that. Also the child he had with Chani is not mentioned. His little sister would have been a great, twisted character but that was removed too... small things here and there that just lowered my enjoyment of the film.

It is also crazy long. By the end of it I couldn't wait to leave the theatre.

In the end, I feel like it was great visually but I felt that it changed details that I thought needed not changing so that lowered my enjoyment of this film considerably. If I was to go back in time I'd probably watch it at home on my tv instead of the theatre. Worth watching but I think that all the praises it's getting are a bit exaggerated, but definitely better than the garbage Disney puts out, so maybe that's why people love it so much.

"If a story is already perfect, why mess with it?","Dune was written in 1965, and it stood the test of time. By making a movie named Dune, why dont u stick by source material? What is this irresistible urge to alter a perfect story with ur mediocre ideas

I will come to straight to point.

1) U ruined the character of Paul. He is a prophet figure, who never wanted war, but he was forced to choose that way because it was the only way. Yet in the final scenes, he ""ordered"" his men to go and fight. He never did anything like this in the books. ""Take them to Paradise""?? Wtf!

2) It was the sister Alia, who despite being child came to Throne Room, killed Baron, threatened Reverend Mother, laughed at Emperor. She achieved many more feats. But she wasn't even born in this movie. Wtf!

3) How long is Paul's mother going to be pregnant? How ridiculous this is? Paul was exiled, and then he formed an army, and conquered a planet, yet his mother is still pregnant? Wtf!

4) I was most upset by Chani. The book Chani, I love her. She supported Paul the most, She loved Paul so much, She was Paul's everything. They also had a son by this time. Paul married Princess Irulan, but never touched her. Chani understood it was a political marriage, it was to save her planet. Chani in the books is so intelligent, calm, brave and she respects Paul.

In the movie, Chani is only making faces on everything Paul is doing.. When every Fremen is supporting Paul, his own wife which is supposed to support him, is against him.. When he ascended to power in the caves infront of all Fremen, she is the only one defying him! Wtf is this character assassination? The ending actually made me like wtf did I watch? My Gf asked me if Chani is going to be against Paul in the next movie, and my only reply was that they assassinated her character.. I need to calm down. Deep Breaths....

5) Where is the spice guild? Spice Guild, Emperor and Great Houses, they form the whole power system, each holding 1/3rd of the power. They were shown in the 1st movie when they didn't deviate from books. They had a major role in the throne room negotiations, but Wow! They weren't even in the movie itself!! Wtf!

There are some good things also.

As I already mentioned, Dune 1 was very good. I recommended that movie to many many people. First half of Dune 2 was also good. Cinematography, Music, the Grandness. But they ruined the second half, especially the ending when it ended on the face of very very angry Chani.

They did same with Witcher, with Game of Thrones, they ruined MCU too. Why cant they respect the original writer who thought all this, & the original story (which made it famous in the first place). Why cant hollywood stick to the source material with minor tweaking, rather than completely messing with it in the wrong way? The way things are looking, Dune 3 is going to be further away from the books.

This movie was a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer easily the G.O.A.T when it comes to a musical score on the big screen.,"This movie was a masterpiece. It's a 600 word requirement for this review so I will say this film had me feel the same vibes you get when you watch the very first Matrix. Worm scene was incredible. Building up Feyd Rautha character was done so well. Excited for a 3rd but it will be hard to imagine how it can be better than this part two which was head & shoulders better than part one. Action was non stop & once again shout out to the greatest movie soundtrack composer of all time Hans Zimmer. He is a national treasure. If you have a favourite movie that comes to mind, Hans was probably behind the musical score behind it. True Legend.

Epic and powerful (but not perfect) cinematic masterpiece,"Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.

Dune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.

This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.

Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.

There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.

Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.

Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timothée Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen ""jihad messiah"" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timothée Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.

However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.

Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.

Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the ""epicness"" ""darkness"" and sense of ""doom"" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.

Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.

Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.

Cinematic Masterpiece,"Cinematography is visually stunning and awe inspiring. The sound design is incredible, especially of the weaponry. The rifle shots look and sound futuristic yet realistic. Captures the essence of the book while cutting out superfluous parts of the book and also avoiding some of the controversial stuff like the Harah character. The entire cast nail their performances. I do wish Denis left in the ecology bits but I understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length. Ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book I guess. Chani overall was a bit more independent and less ""submissive."" In the book Chani accepts some ""traditional"" gender roles while in the movie it clear that Chani is never subservient to Paul. I knew they would ""update"" the story for today's society so the changes expected.

'The Two Towers' of this generation,"Villeneuve wanted this movie to stand on its two feet, will still being a continuation of the last film. It delivers on both fronts. The quality of the shots, acting, pacing is still there from the last movie. You can put both parts together as one movie and it would work. The dream sequences were not as impactful as they were in the last movie, and almost non existent when Paul is enlightened by prescience. If we were to look through his mind like it was in the book, the message of the danger of charismatic leaders might have been less impactful.

With only a few flaws and nitpicks, Dune Part 2 is worthy of a watch.

Still taking its time to perfect the beat,"What a looker Timothée Chalamet is. With his green eyes, androgynous face and smooth curly hair, he is so photogenic all the time, that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments, you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials he's recently been in under the direction of Martin Scorsese. And Denis Villeneuve knows this.

So much so, in fact, that he's decided to hype us up even more in ""Part Two"", again taking his time, making sure the light on Chalamet's should-be insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to ""Lawrence of Arabia""--the timeless masterpiece epic that Villeneuve also adores. So yeah, the teasing here has intensified; but so did the good things: the anti-elitist themes found in Frank Herbert's novel now go deeper into themes of faith, religion and manipulation; the scope is grander; the cinematography? Jaw-dropping! Especially the black and white homeworld of the Harkonnen, Giedi Prime, on which Austin Butler's villainous Feyd-Rautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin. And for the first time in Villeneuve's career, there are genuinely funny moments too.

Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a better movie than its predecessor. And it's quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie. Instead, Villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting Herbert's novel to its full power. And it pays off. Even if there is no catharsis in ""Part Two"", the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal. Without going into the chunky plot, just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for what's to come.

Is a dangerous game director/writer Denis Villeneuve is playing by making so many promises. Or maybe it's not. I am sure a lot of people already felt fully satisfied with this movie even at this point. My friend whom I saw the movie with absolutely swears by it, calling it one of the greatest sci-fi movies in recent history. Me? I hope to be able to say the same about its sequel--or sequels? Because if they will turn up on par with their hype, my friend will be absolutely right.",8/10,26 May 2024,danielgroza,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Long awaited,"While it without a doubt is a masterclass in editing, cinematography, SOUND DESIGN :0, casting I can't seem to ignore the glaring flaws. The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.

Even though there is no doubt about its ""epicness"" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.

The third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.

Overall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past. It is one of the great modern sci fi's but dare I say, didn't exactly live up to the hype. See it at the biggest screen possible, 8/10.",8/10,28 February 2024,SuperReviewerSwede,Dune: Part Two (2023),POSITIVE
Interesting,"I see quite a lot of positive reviews here from younger audiences. It seems dune struck a cord in all born after 2000. Which I guess is a good thing. Calling it the best movie of all time is something else. It means you first have to watch all films of all time to make such a bold assessment. And secondly Villeneuves rendering needs to be something special. It is not.

There has been other and better movies displaying the same story line, scenes and composition. Sorry to disappoint you Gen-Zers or below.

Even Frank Herbert confest himself to be inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. Now this film is one you need to see (no sand worms there unfortunately)

The story-arch and intrigues are also not new. Even cliche. The high-rise hero falling for the lowly dame and ultimately dump her? Nothing new (but Dune 5 will show something different) Apart from the well orchestrated mass fight and one on one fight scenes we have seen way to often this movie has very little to offer. There really is no suprise only quite a lot of wasted talent on Rampling and Walker (those are boomers btw) There is no surprise, no novelty in this movie. It is a boring arrangement of boring repeats. Even Hans went back to a repetition of what we have heard (before Interstallar, that was truy awesome)

If you want to see a movie in the desert go watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see a messias go watch Matrix. If you want to see a good sci fi movie go see, ehm. 2001?",6/10,12 April 2024,TheKing2,Dune: Part Two (2023),NEGATIVE
Perfect theatrical sequeal,"When I first watched Dune two years ago I couldn't get enough of the story or the surrounding lore. I read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe. At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments. I loved this movie, it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of Frank Herbert.

Spectacle,"Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.

Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.

This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.

Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.

There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.

And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.

So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.

Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.

Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.

The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.

Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts.

Overhyped mess,"Where do I bring, well this movie is not good. Everyone heaping praise on it must be drunk or so starved for anything that looks good that they'll just blindly nod and smile.

It's slow and I don't mean regular slow, I mean Zak Snyder super slow. If you're going to make a movie three hours long, fill it will interesting characters a d good dialogue. Don't just fill it with scenes that add nothing to the story.

Secondly, and this is my biggest gripe. Why do Timothee and Zendaya sounds the like they're a couple of Californian kids there for spring break. Paul's mum doesn't even bother hiding her British accent, Javier is the only one putting in any effort to sound like an indigenous population.

Plot holes, so many plot holes. In the beginning Paul's mum magically transports to kill someone about to kill Paul, how?

The freemen attack the harkonnen and no the ship has guns, Zendaya has a gun but everyone else sword fights for some reason.

Paul rides a worm, worm could at any moment dive deep and the rider is dead. This is some of the stupidest writing I have ever read.

Chemistry, Zendaya and Timothee don't have any

Visuals, amazing the movie looks incredible which is why I imagine everyone is gushing over it.

A Masterclass in Science Fiction.,"It seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact. But Dune Part II left me wanting more. I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth. Go and Watch this movie. It is mesmerizing.

"""The Prophet shall know the ways of the desert.""","This was a more than competent follow up to 2021's ""Dune"", which didn't carry a 'Part 1' included in the title. As an early 2024 movie release, much of its impact will be gone by the time the next awards season arrives, but true film fans will recognize it as a top contender for the year's best, even if we've got more than a half year to go yet as I write this. Visually, the picture is more than impressive, however I was expecting more from the scenes of the Shai-Hulud, the giant sand worm that the story's hero summoned to demonstrate his acceptance as the Muad 'Dib of the Fremen people, 'The One Who Points the Way'. The one Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) rode was all but invisible, contrasted with those scenes in which a sand worm engulfed enemies of the Fremen earlier in the picture, reminiscent of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pet Sarlacc from ""Star Wars"".

One thing that seemed ambiguous was the relationship between Paul and Chani (Zendaya). At times her facial and body language showed disapproval with Paul, even as they expressed their undying love for each other. I can only attribute that to the fact that Paul was an outsider to the Fremens, and his stature as the future Lisan al-Gaib might have been considered heretical. Even so, her obvious disapproval with Paul at various times felt out of place, except near the end when Paul expressed his willingness to marry Princess Iluran (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) right after he told Chani he would love her forever. At that point it felt like Paul was acting more on his own behalf in a quest for power than what was appropriate for the Fremens.

A major surprise for this viewer was the casting of Austin Butler in the role of Feyd-Rautha, nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). I didn't recognize the 'Elvis"" actor in his albino guise as the promised future Emperor. Once again, in terms of an ambiguous outcome, I couldn't perceive how Paul reversed his enemy's knife to defeat Feyd-Rautha in the final contest for the Emperor's throne. And finally, how we've gotten this far into the story to find out only now that Paul's mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) was a Harkonnen was quite troubling. How would Paul's deceased father not have known, and consequently, the viewer. That twist sort of defied one's understanding of the relationships among the principal characters.

Lastly, where one might have expected a definitive resolution to the Dune saga, the story leaves threads hanging with the impending birth of the mystical baby girl carried by Reverend Mother Jessica, and the fierce resolve of Chani in abandoning Paul. I had not gone beyond the original Frank Herbert ""Dune"" novel myself, and this film's conclusion points me in the direction of following up with 'Dune Messiah"".

It has everything you want in a dune sequel,"Before I get Into detail about this movie I just want to say that it's a fantastic movie and it's everything I wanted from the sequel.

The story is on point. It's very well paced and it doesn't drag like some parts of the first movie. The dialogue is well written, and impactful.

The main character arc is awesome. The story arc of other supporting characters is also very well done. They have great character development. The new antagonist is awesome.

The production value was very good. The score like the last film was amazing. The editing was on point. I just have nothing but good things to say about this movie.

"In some respects, outstanding!","Unlike Dune Part 1, the wonderful other-worldly music in Dune Part 2 didn't drown out the soft-spoken dialogues. That said, by the sparse music soundtrack, my hunch is the producers, director, and music editors went too far in the other direction.

Dune Part 2 continued the same awe-inspiring cinematography and breath-taking visual effects. However, its sometimes-mundane script and pedestrian storyline was held together by a superior, solid acting and editing. The costuming was, for the most part, magnificent. However, in a couple of battle scenes, the nearly identical battle garb made it very difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. But the scenes of the good guys riding atop the gigantic desert worms was absolutely thrilling! Wound I recommend watching Dune Part 2? Absolutely.

Really a good adaptation,"Overall, much better than Dune: Part 1. Most of the actors were well cast and they acted well. The visuals were fantastic and it really made the world come alive. Paul was believable and Jessica is perfect- really no complaints with the main actors, except Chani. Sadly, they ruined Chani's character. In the books, she is Paul's primary supporter and she grounds him. Here, Chani is abrasive and antagonizes him. It was extremely annoying watching this extremely important character be butchered by Zendaya. Hopefully she is redeemed in the next iteration, but even if she is, the film and series is hurt by this baffling direction.

What modern science fiction needs,"Dune 2 is, in my opinion, what modern science fiction and fantasy need. It is a phenomenally shot film with amazing performance from Timothée Chalamet and zendaya. The story is interesting and kept me engaged the whole 2 hours and 46 minute runtime. All that and an absolutely breathtaking soundtrack thanks to hans zimmer. My only issue with the film was that, in my opinion, the pacing was a bit off. A friend of mine who has read the books was a little bit dissapointed in the film, according to him the books go more into deatail about some caracters backstory and overall weaves a much more interesting story, but i am not reviewing the book, and he's not reviewing the movie, and i think that as a stand alone film, it is a masterpiece.

"A scene between an intelligent raccoon, a rabbit with artificial legs, a walrus with wheels and an otter with metal arms made me cry","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.

I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.

Highlights:

Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.

Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.

The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.

Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.

Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.

One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.

I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.

9/10 for me.

A Fitting and Heartfelt End to the Trilogy,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.

At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.

The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",8/10,4 May 2023,ta-98251,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
A Beautifully Dark and Goofy Goodbye,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",9/10,3 May 2023,breneff,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Best Marvel film this year,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.

One of the Best MCU Trilogies,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.

While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.

The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.

Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.

Best Character: Drax Best Quote: ""She is to us."" Best Scene: Infiltrating Orgocorp Best Piece of Score: ""I Love You Guys""",9/10,8 May 2023,jace_the_film_guy,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
I Cried Four Times,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.

From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.

The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.

"This is one of the best MCU movies, hands down","""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.

I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.

The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.

At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",9/10,7 May 2023,gcsman,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Much better than most of the recent Marvel projects but not as strong as the previous Guardians of the Galaxy instalments,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.

Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.

The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.

A perfect send off for the Guardians,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)

The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.

This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.

Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.

You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",9/10,3 May 2023,georgewhittingham1,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Lacks the charm of its prequels,"I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.

This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.

This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.

In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.

All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.",6/10,6 May 2023,Ayupgeeza,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
I am groot,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.

Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.

Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.

I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.",8/10,3 May 2023,AfricanBro,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
"Finally, Marvel start to return to its roots","The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.

Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.

Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.

Sometimes less is more,"I'm seeing mostly glowing reviews and I think I may have seen a different movie. This was a loud, annoying, confused movie. It couldn't get out of it's own way. Somehow dark and cutesy at the same time. Adam Warlock was unnecessary to the story and poorly written. Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours. The High Evelutionary is way too over the top to the point where he's mostly just distracting. There were audible groans in the theater when Kraglin sees Yondu during the big battle.

There were positives, too. The flashbacks of Rocket were well done and moving. The FX were mostly great. Some of the songs were great songs and fit well in the movie. Some of the banter was funny. There was just way too much.

Just incredible,"I've talked about this before, how expectations can mold your appreciation of a movie, so let me tell you what my mindset was coming into this one. I liked the first Guardians, although not as much as everyone else as I think Ronan is such a forgettable villain. I really didn't like the second one and thought it was a huge step down from the first one, it felt rushed and had another very weak villain. Marvel was coming off of a terrible string of movies and I even didn't like the Guardians Christmas special. I was still a fan of James Gunn though, and loved his Suicide Squad so there was that to look forward to. So, to say I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did is the understatement of the year. Another thing I wanted to talk about after watching this movie, was the much talked about superhero fatigue. When people mention it I think they tend to dismiss or forget that two incredible superhero movies came out this year alone (the other one being the Spiderverse movie, of course), so it just proves that if well written and well executed a superhero movie can still be really good, what people are tired is the terrible writing and lack of originality that populates most superhero movies released nowadays. Anyway, with all that out of the way, let me tell you just how much I loved this movie. It is incredibly well written, interweaving character development, emotional set pieces, comedy and action like it's nothing, with the highlight for me being the characters which are the heart of this thing. I mean, Star-Lord, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Drax, Mantis, Groot, even all the supporting characters like Cosmo, Kraglin or Adam Warlock, they're all so likable that you can probably ask ten different persons which one is their favorite, and you might get ten different answers. That's a testament of how good they all are! Execution wise, this is a beautiful movie, very well directed and the VFX for a change are actually good and serve to enhance the story. My only nitpick might be the villain that, although good conceptually and probably the best of this trilogy, is not as memorable as everything else, something that seems to plague all Gunn movies. Anyway, I really, really liked this movie and it is easily in my top five MCU movies. Highly recommended.",8/10,5 February 2024,bastos,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Emotional and energetic!,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!

thrilling ending,"The ending to the guardians of the galaxy movies didn't miss action, comedy or romance. The way it played with the soundtrack was on another level. You'll notice it's filming techniques are up to date and the cgi had nothing to complain about, no goofy ahh MODOC cgi (quantumania) or scenes that looked like they were filmed on a blank green screen, it truely was a work of cinema and lacked nothing in this way. Although it was your typical villain from the past coming back for revenge, this story was probably the saddest marvel project to date and hit harder than I was expecting.

Watch this in the biggest screen you can, completely worth it.

Rocket and Love,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.

The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.

This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.

Did not work like it used to,"I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.

All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.

Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.

I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.

For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)

It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.",6/10,7 May 2023,PizzaBizza,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
Thank you Guardians,"I remember that I had the feeling of joy, thrill, amusement, and particular sadness watching the previous 2 installments. While the 2 previous were talking mostly about Quill's backstory and his fear of losing his beloved ones, this 3rd installment speaks about Rocket's same particular issue. And I LOVE IT.

Rocket deserved his story to be told, and I (again) experienced the same roller coaster of feeling like I had years ago (in 2014 and 2017).

Thank you James Gunn, thank you everyone involved in this movie.

This is a complete way to wrap up the trilogy, it has a lot of massive explosions and so did emotions and heart.

Guardians, galaxy still needs you but thanks for being a part of our best memories.

You all will be missed.",10/10,3 May 2023,eldianyosuab,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Wasn't prepared for how traumatic it would be!,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends). While it ends up mostly okay, I'm never watching it again as long as I live. Triggered all sorts of childhood movie PTSD - not sure it needed to be that harsh and traumatising to be honest!

Phenomenal movie,"Absolutely phenomenal in my opinion. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was not only super emotional (after Endgame I'd say the most emotional Marvel movie), the CGI and the action scenes were incredibly good as well. In some scenes it was super messed up and weird, but exactly these scenes made the movie so good.

I still don't loose hope to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxy, because they are one my favorite heroes in the MCU.

The music was also on point again, even tho it didn't reach the music from the previous parts, especially not the tracks from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but all in all I loved it!

Typical Marvel issues,"Speeding up an action sequence until it is a blur doesn't make it more exciting. Louder isn't better and it doesn't add to the story or experience. The story isn't bad but it is held back with the modern Marvel Studios decisions to make every battle more 'epic' than the last. More people, faster spinning, louder noise and rinse and repeat with 10% more for each battle. Acting was alright, story was alright, soundtrack was solid enough, designs were good but sped up to blur and volume raised to pounding distracted rather than complemented. I wish I could have seen more of the details in the world but sped up to fast and it was all a blur.

A total miss that didn't need to be,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.

This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.

Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?

That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.

Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.

Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.

The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.

Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.

The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.

The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.

I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.

We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.

I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.

I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.

It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.

Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.

All heroes start somewhere,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.

The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).

""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""

The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.

The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",9/10,3 May 2023,rexmatthewj,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
"""Ain't no thing like me, except me!"" (No, James Gunn, there really isn't). :)","This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.

Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.

Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.

In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.

Never Cried Like this in Any Superhero Movie.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is one of the best movie in Marvel Cinematic Universe. Really I cried like 3/4 times in a single movie, I laughed so hard and i Enjoyed the Soundtrack of this movie.

James Gunn really does justice to every characters in his Movie. This Movie had screentime for each and every member of the Guardians. The CGI was so clean and perfect. The introduction of Adam Warlock was one of the best Introduced Scene i have seen in cinematic history.

If you Cry and root for talking Racoon and a Talking Tree then THIS IS THE CINEMA. This has the perfect ending i have ever seen in a movie.

I won't hesitate to say this is the Best CBM Trilogy of all time.

A beautiful send of to our favourite group of ragtag misfits,"9 years, 6 movies and one special presentation later... its time to say goodbye to our guardians. The movie was done in typical Guardians style with some kick ass tunes and plenty of laughs but this movie had so much more heart than the previous 2 titles. The story mainly focuses on Rockets backstory, which is absolutely tragic and heartbreaking. The only disappointing thing was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, he was powerful enough but portrayed as a child and kind of stupid... basically like drax, but less funny. If ypu enjoyed the previous 2 guardians movies then I highly recommend you go check this out. Definitely one of the better MCU movies since Endgame.

Not great,"This was pretty disappointing as I loved the first Guardians movie (and enjoyed the second one). It just felt like a bit of a mess, and the acting and dialogue was not as good as the earlier MCU films.

Overall it was enjoyable and the 150 minutes passed relatively quickly, but way too much CGI for me and every time I started getting into it, I found myself snapped out of it by a corny line.

One of the biggest issues with it is that the ""grown up"" Rocket was largely absent from the movie and instead the character appeared though a highly disturbing yet at the same time saccharine back story.

Even the soundtrack seemed all over the place. It includes a couple of real gems (from Faith No More and Beastie Boys in particular) but there didn't seem to be a any time period or genre which linked all the tunes together. Maybe that's the point, but it felt a bit like Quill had left his iPod on shuffle.",6/10,8 May 2023,philwicksteed,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
Outstanding emotional payoff.,"This packed an emotional wallop.

It had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.

It had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them. It had a heart- rending back story.

It had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.

It did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.

It is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.

I had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.

This easily tops ALL of them, by some distance. LOVED IT.",8/10,3 September 2023,ragingbull_2005,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
A messy but enjoyable send-off,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.

With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.

There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.

But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.

Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",7/10,3 May 2023,Jeremy_Urquhart,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Perfect finale to an incredible trilogy!,"Really don't know how to express my emotions properly but wow what a perfect finale to an incredible trilogy!!! The movie was just so beautiful is so many ways!! All the characters shined and got equal screen time, really showed them all as an equal team! The story was touching and meaningful, the performance from the entire cast were phenomenal, a certain scene with Pratt broke my heart because he delivered an amazing nuanced performance, same with the rest of the cast, they all delivered amazing performances in regards to emotional scenes, action and comedy!! The cinematography and music were excellent!! So glad James Gunn returned to direct it. I'm going to miss the Guardians and this incredible cast so much!!!

"It's different, but not necessarily in a good way.","Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.

First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.

And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.

Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.

The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.

My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.

So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.

In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",6/10,5 May 2023,Ky-D,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
A review placing me firmly in the minority,"This review contains no spoilers (and really there is nothing to spoil)

I loved the first two Guardians movies. Yes they had fantastic special effects. Loads of action, yes. But more importantly they were well written, well thought out, well acted, had some truly beautiful choreography. The humor was fantastic. Quirky and clever. There were some truly touching moments. They made you think a bit, but they also made you feel something. They were more than movies. They were an experience. And I had dearly hoped that this last installment would live up to my expectations, but to my deep disappointment it did not.

This movie like so many others today demands that we move past the reasonable suspension of disbelief, and into the suspension of intelligence.

The non-stop action and pretty colors didn't save it from a plot full of holes. The humor managed to produce a chuckle or two yes, but ultimately it felt trite, forced, staged. And cinema is chock full of examples showing that a talented cast cannot salvage a movie from bad writing. Honestly, every time the movie tripped on a moment that was supposed to illicit some kind of emotional response I found myself cringing and thinking the script, the dialogue, must have been cobbled together by someone so lacking in emotional depth that the best they can do is regurgitate the old tropes they've seen watching other shows. They can't create what they don't understand so the best they can manage is to mimic. It was painful.

And the fact that this movie has been given a rating of 8.3 by the viewing public tells me people have lost the ability to distinguish good from bad. I guess if Hollywood feeds people garbage long enough they stop realizing it's garbage and start thinking it's caviar.

To me it's just another ugly sign of the ongoing decay of society. We have lost an appreciation for finer things. Most people can't even recognize quality any more. The older I get (and I'm not that old, yet) the more I have to look to the past for good cinema. Or to IFC movies. Or to foreign films.

Mainstream media today is more and more....empty calories. It's bright, it's loud, it's fast....and it's it devoid or any real sustenance.

What value this movie had was only in that it convinced me that there in the long, sad decline of Marvel there is no bottom. And it's time to stop giving them my money.",4/10,22 May 2023,lifebythesmile,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
A poignant and heartfelt finale,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.

In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.

Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",9/10,10 May 2023,cardsrock,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
"How a Raccoon, an Otter, a walrus and a Bunny stole my heart!","Marvel has presented us with abysmal contents for the last few years. But this was not it. A truly heartfelt rendition by James Gunn has nibbled a bit of my heart in a corner. Rocket truly deserved his story be told to us and this was a genuinely beautiful way of doing it. I hope Marvel keeps making stories this good in the years to come and give them the proper time to be developed instead of rushing them out of the door for the next quarterly board meeting.

Nothing more to say.

Performance was great. Story was beautifully executed. This is what happens when artists work on a piece on their own. Please get the suites to keep sitting at their chairs and let the real people do the work they were meant to do.

Perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy,"Sorry if my English is bad.

It came out in May 3rd in Japan and we were blessed with this masterpiece a bit earlier than the US.

As my review title states, perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy. This is most definitely one of the best superhero trilogy of all time behind ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. I honestly think they have completely different style so it is impossible to simply compare them but there is no doubt that this movie is a masterpiece in its own way.

Although I've watched every MCU movie, after ""Endgame"" they gradually became dull and boring to the point I was watching solely by a force of habit. But this movie completely changed everything. I had my hopes up high and it did not let me down.

Must watch for any Marvel fans, James gunn fan and genuinely anybody in search for a fun entertaining flick although I would reccomend you to at least watch the previous 2 movies of the trilogy.

Amazing. Thank you James Gunn.",10/10,3 May 2023,eitaishiguro,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Good...but oversold and underwhelming.,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.

Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.

Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.

The Good: The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.

The Bad: Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.

Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....

Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.


Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.


Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.


Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.


All of this is just the opening scene....

Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.


Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.


Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.


Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.


Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.

Love James Gunn but this felt a little off.,"The first Guardians of the Galaxy really surprised me and I loved the movie (so much it was my top favourite Marvel until No Way Home), and the second wasn't as great but still enjoyed it. This one made me feel.... Really let down and wanting more.

I did enjoy the more serious tone in parts - especially how Quill felt more like an anti-hero and hardened from all his losses, Nebula and Rocket were very well written, and how it felt like genuine closure for many of the characters stories, but for me that was kind of it.

First it felt like the characters, specially Drax/Nebula/Mantis didn't like each other for most of the film (which was strange as the whole thing is set up to be protecting one of their own) and Adam Warlock was SUPER underwhelming - really felt more his whole point of existence was to save Quill in the end. And I get they wanted to make Drax more of a parent in this film, but I felt like Gamora in the sense they wanted the old Drax gone and made him knew to the point he's a whole new character. I'm also not sure how to feel about Gamora's plot; I liked her roughness but also felt she was too angsty and didn't like anyone; but also Quill felt a little similar to that in Guardians 1, so maybe to show how the ravagers affected them and their childhood traumas.

The humour was definitely different too, but was unsure how much of it was genuinely funny or not. Also the amount of fake out deaths (like seriously both Drax and Nebula should have died more than once but are miraculously healed scenes later) was really strange, cause James Gunn is a great writer where that isn't needed. The soundtrack was good for the most part, but where in between kidnapping Kevin Bacon and Tony Stark's funeral did Quill learn about ""Creep"" but more importantly ""The Dog Days are Over""? Do not get me wrong I adore both Radiohead and Florence Welsh but it felt like my own spotify shuffle going from 90's to 70's to 80's to 2000's....

I will say too - the multiple shots of animal abuse was definitely not needed. I get Rocket had a super traumatic upbringing, but seeing animals with robotic parts or destroyed in a chamber felt very excessive. IDK why we needed about 5 different flashbacks of it but I genuinely felt like I couldn't sit through the rest of the movie after the 2nd scene. I think it should be more discussed in reviews that happens as it can be triggering for young kids and even some adults.

A Satisfying Conclusion,"James Gunn strikes the perfect balance of heart and humour in this emotionally satisfying and heart-wrenching finale. The film's conclusion showcases the growth and evolution of the beloved team of misfits as they come together in an epic battle to save the galaxy and protect one of their own. From start to finish, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 is a masterfully crafted blockbuster that easily surpasses even the highest of expectations, cementing its place as one of the best films in the franchise.

The film is a masterful conclusion to the beloved series. With great performances, stunning visuals, an epic soundtrack, and a satisfying conclusion to the story, it's a must-watch for any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. James Gunn manages to bring everything full circle while also providing an emotional and action-packed ride.

Needed this one today,"Not gonna trauma dump but I watched this movie today as it's now on Disney and man... this is the right time of my life for a movie like this to come around. I'm not the biggest Marvel anymore. I didn't finish secret invasion and the only MCU movie I've seen in cinemas since No Way Home was black panther. I would have seen GOTG V3 but I watched spiderverse instead. Absolutely adore that movie and it's actually my favourite movie even though I watch a large variety and don't only indulge myself with the super hero genre. This isn't a review as much as it just me sharing how I felt but let me tell you; if you wanna watch something heartfelt yet entrancing and comedic, then this is the movie for you. I had to take a break from the movie when there was an hour left and not in particular because of the movie as such, but I cried the most I ever have in a long time. Rocket's story was so tragic yet deeply blissful. I got nervous and sad plenty in the final act thinking someone was going to die but thankfully no one did. I like it much better that way. Anyway, it's late and I'm emotional (plus this isn't reddit) so good day everyone!

Goodness Gracious...,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.

Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.

Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.

But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.

There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.

But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.

Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.

And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home. But I'm not lying about this.

Each Hero has a story,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.

I love living in New Zealand!,"Just came out of the opening night in New Zealand and have to say GOTG3 has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! Will definitely be going back to watch this again!

There's a mid credit and an end credit scene to wait around for too!

The CGI was amazing, character development and jokes were spot on. Was never let down by the pace the 2 and a half hours flew by. The first f bomb in a marvel movie had everyone cracking up.

Music yet again was spot on. Adam and Drax stole the show with one of the best marvel villains to date.

Classic case of critiques hating for views don't listen to them go see the movie you won't regret it!

Straight 10/10,"No other rating gives this movie justice other than 10/10. It's a true masterpiece. Everything is cohesive and touching. A great thank you to James Gunn for making this happen. Marvel is truly going to miss him.

The storyline is beautiful, intricate but still simple and touching. Each character is so masterfully developed by its own and while there is lots going on, nothing is irrelevant or misplaced. The soundtrack is phenomenal, there is no other words to describe it. I hope we can see more of the guardians even though this is technically the any one.

Easily best 3 movies ever made by Marvel.

Not up to earlier Guardian of the Galaxy films.,"Good to get some serious back story regarding Rocket, but the rest of the film was rather weak.

Much of the comedy seemed forced and insincere, and an overall plot being too predictable and forgettable. It would have benefitted from some better editing, there were just too many scenes that seemed to go on for too long and with no real meaning.

Seeing the graphic detail of Rocket's earlier abuse and mistreatment may not go well with children expecting a more fun creature depicted in the earlier films. This mix of the more dark look into life did not blend well with the often excessive lightheartedness in other parts of the film.

The first film in the series, great fun; the second, all right; this, definitely a 'could do better' score.

Masterpiece!,"This movie is my favorite of the 3 guardians movies. I went to a media screening the day before the wide release and it had everyone in the theater clapping and crying by the end of it. It really starts off fast and never lets up from there. They mix in drama and comedy masterfully and really set up the future of the franchise. There are parts that are difficult to watch if you are an animal lover. The exciting addition of adam warlock to the franchise opens up a lot of new possibilities for the future. The high evolutionary is one of the most brutal villains in any marvel movie! There are 2 post credit scenes!

It was OK,"I'd have maybe gone 6.5 if it was an option.

I do think it was worth seeing on the big screen, but it wasn't as good as the first two, and it kind of felt unfinished in places. I thought rocket's story worked really well, and got me a bit tearful in places.

But Will Pouter? I liked where he started and where he ended, but the whole middle seemed to be missing. I liked that people got to see more in Drax even if he didn't see more in himself.

Despite being over 2.5 hours long, it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. 1 You know, there was enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, but you did have to ignore the missing beats in a lot of the subplots.

Overall, I thought it was like that one good song on an album by a band in a slump that's not as good as there best stuff but is just about good enough to make you think they still have something going on.",7/10,6 May 2023,jamesmcconnon,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Best of the Guardians series?,"I just left the cinema & my immediate thoughts was that was quite possibly the best of the Guardians of the Galaxy series & the best MCU film since No Way Home (or possibly endgame) it's definitely one I'll be seeing again! It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!

Just an Average Flick with Few Likeable Moments,"***Guardians of Galaxy Volume 3 English Movie Review***

Directed by James Gunn, the movie travels around the life of the Rocket & how his friends fight for him is all about Volume 3 Movie.

So, if expecting too much, the movie will be a big disaster but still there are some moments which I personally felt likeable.

1) The bond of the friendship. The efforts they take to save their rocket.

2) Some comic moments from Drax.

3) A fight sequence when the film about to end in 15 to 20 min, the choreography was superbly taken. It just travelled me of Avengers: Age of Ultron climax fight sequence.

But I am frowned by watching the end credits. It was as if Marvel made us ludicrous.

Letdown of the Galaxy,"I'm not quite sure how a franchise that has knocked it out of the park to date (with one exception) could've messed up the formula this badly.

Maybe I should've paid more attention to the writing on the wall after that one Christmas Special miss, but I just assumed that project was an easy paycheck and not a directional change.

GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout. On paper, the High Evolutionary storyline should've worked, but they spend far too much time away from it. The way they shoehorned Adam Warlock into the movie was almost criminal for a character that important.

There's a lot more, but I don't want to accidentally do a spoiler review.

It wasn't bad. But the flaws are so hard to ignore that I left the theater disappointed. If you're being honest, you did to.",5/10,6 May 2023,gdkvgf,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
I never thought that i'd feel so many feelings in a marvel movie ever again,"In my opinion Marvel is dead, and nothing can change that. But that doesn't change the fact that this has made me feel the most that i ever has when watching a movie. I could go from hysterical laughter in one scene to crying like i just lost a loved one. And i'm not exaggerating.

The scene where Rocket, Floor, Teefs and Lylla are about to escape really hit, especially because of their innocence, and after Lylla is killed, Floor just keeps saying ""Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now"" just really hit. I am actually sitting here crying as i write this by just thinking about it.

In my opinion, if a movie can make you feel such strong emotions, then it must be a 10/10.

BEST MCU MOVIE SINCE NO WAY HOME,"Just watched Guardian's Of The Galaxy Volume 3 and in my opinion it was amazing. This movie was heartfelt and it had some of the best action I've seen from a Marvel movie. The villian was everything I wanted from Kang. He was scary he showed his power and most importantly killed people. All of the Guardian's had there time to shine but most importantly was Rocket. We got his tragic backstory that we got to see throughout the movie and even got to see him face off against The High Evolutionary near the end of the movie. Honestly everything was perfect. I've wanted a good marvel movie for so long and this movie finally did that.

FINALLY. Marvel has 1 good movie post end game.,"Words to discribe this:

Touching Heartfelt Loving Funny Action packed Appreciative

And just SUCH a good movie over all. All the actors did such a good job and it was such a good ending to the trilogy. Even though, they will eventually be back in cameo's. (Hint, hint.)

It was also so nice to see Rocket's story and honestly I am an animal lover, so I almost cried. Yes I have only almost cried at 3 movies, Braveheart, Armageddon and now GG3. LOL

Thank you everyone that has helped to stop the making of cheesy Disney style Marvel movies and hopefully we can turn the tide back to the Marvel style of story telling. (Even though there was a lot of Disney in this one, it worked for ONCE.)

Perfect idea for a movie DNE perfect movie,"This series has long been centered around the theme of not running away from your pain, and this movie continues this but also sets focus on the theme of not just facing your pain but actively repairing it.

Peter and Rocket both run for the comfort of other people, creating negative circumstances like Peter vying for a woman who will not love him. The antagonist also plays on this theme, torching every mistake he makes in the comforting hope of an impossible future.

Paired with things like animal experimentation, Quill's lost girlfriend, etc., it is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy 1. And much like that first movie, its execution fumbles the story and emotional potential.

However, whereas GotG 1 had its potential undercut by larger problems, such as an over reliance on flat exposition, this movie's problems are more subtle and don't have an easy common thread to generalize the problem with the movie.

One of the earliest off-beats I noticed was when Nebula witnesses Rocket's origin. It's pretty profound and inspired to have one victim of cybernetic torture witness their friend's hidden past of being cybernetically experimented on. In theory it makes for a great scene, but it is weirdly undercut by Nebula one-upping her own pain by saying Rocket's was worse.

Firstly, how?? Rocket is mostly bodily intact, and the experiments done on him we're not intended for deliberate punishment and torture like Nebula's was. Nebula's anatomy is much more grotesque and implied to be extensively manipulated down to her mind and bones, whereas Rocket's seem less deep.

Secondly, this is an opportunity to establish an emotional connection between Nebula and Rocket, clumsily using it to say Rocket's pain is worse breaks that connection and implies that the torture hasn't been adequately shown to the audience and has to be told to us. Weird.

The second thing that threw me off was the implied existence of God during the Rocket Heaven scene. I understand that there being a happy afterlife poses a considerably better way to look at Batch 89's deaths, but I can't say how odd it comes in such a secular universe. I'm an atheist so I'm not sure I would ever find this compelling, but I do think I would have been less blindsided and more able to appreciate the moment had the theme of there being an actual God been developed.

Much of the finale threw me off in fact. One of the biggest things was all the side character plot resolutions. Themes like being a follower vs being who you want to be were never really explored with Mantis until the very last second. Or Kraglin and not listening to his heart.

There was also weird missed opportunities, like no child coming up to hold Drax's hand as Mantis leaves, showing how the temporary hole his friend leaves can be filled by being a good role model to the next generation. Also I can't really track what the whole ""dancing is for idiots"" thing was about and why Drax danced at the end. What was the thematic conflict going on there?

And finally, Peter expecting to only save the ""higher life forms"" is a really odd moment. This valuing one life over another thing is never really developed as a trait in the rest of the Guardians, but suddenly it's implied that Peter did have this value and it's immediately resolved by Peter and the Guardians helping Rocket save a bunch of animals.

Although this feels like a pretty big thematic gap in Rocket and Peter's stories, otherwise they are done pretty perfectly in comparison to the rest. Peter's arc about not using crutches in life and repairing his past is executed with no falter, and Rocket's acceptance of his past and righting the wrongs done to him felt very fulfilling (aside from the aforementioned sudden theology insertion and the weird incomplete resolution of his loneliness with the Guardians half broken up at the end). Rocket's is probably one of my favorite in fiction.

So I do think this movie is kinda overrated. The idea of it really is great and explains why people like it, but being attentive clues you into some big thematic and execution issues that make the emotional moments feel a bit off and less than you were expecting. I'd give the movie a 8/10 for being pretty emotionally compelling and funny but ultimately having some large hidden issues and execution problems.

Unpopular opinion: Umm I didn't love it,"I'm a Guardians fan and MCU nerd and I didn't love this one. I'll watch it 85 more times I'm sure but it missed the mark with me on first watch. It's more violent and dark than the previous ones but I felt sucker punched for emotional gotchas, not substance. It felt rushed and strained credulity (even for a movie set in space with gadgets and creatures aplenty) somehow. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind or sad that this is the final installment, plus the theater was crappy with poor sound. Hopefully upon rewatch I'll get on board.

It was good to see the crew again and close the loop on some storylines. I definitely LOLed enough to embarrass my kids and the soundtrack was outstanding. It wasn't bad but it was a little bit of a letdown...

Heroism With Heart,"Exploring Rocket Raccoon's origin story let ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" give one of its most famous characters well-deserved and heartfelt attention.

Technically, this is a story forty years in the making. Because Rocket's first entry goes back to the Marvel Preview #7 comic book titled ""The Sword in the Star"". There have since been several other comic books that delved into this character's life and times, capturing his badassery and charisma.

In ""Vol. 3"" James Gunn gave us a powerful and profound plotline, blessed with more than a few endearing moments and regaling soundtracks.

It was also nice to see Gamora in a partially negative role, and not to forget Sylvester Stallone (as Stakar Ogord). In this timeline (emphasis on the word), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana) was no longer with the titular Guardians. She was brought back following the undoing of Thanos's work after ""Infinity War"". But she was back to being a ruthless Ravager with no memory of her connection to Peter and the Guardians.

Meanwhile Peter Quill, after a period of drunken love-lorn mourning, found himself gathering the Guardians and embarking on a timed mission to save Rocket's life or risk losing his friend forever.

Next, everything about Adam Warlock (played by Will Poulter) - one of the villains at the heart of this movie - was both exciting and hilarious. He and Rocket had something in common, especially the fact that they were both genetically engineered beings. This made Rocket 'proprietary technology' (i.e., Subject 89P13) and the High Evolutionary, working under Oracle Corporation, sent Adam to collect.

With his ability to manipulate energy and matter, the 'Cosmic Crusader' was given an amazing live-action spin in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". His first comic-book entry was in ""Fantastic Four #66"" (published, 1967) and he's appeared in several stories since.

I wish they found someone who looked more like the Adam Warlock from the comics, but Poulter's acting chops were more than adequate compensation. Besides, he gradually became a force to reckon with in the comics. Here in the movie, the character was just getting started. Hence his silly-funny 'newborn' incompetence.

The big-bad in ""Vol. 3"" was the High Evolutionary. In keeping with his trail of destruction in comic-book lore, the 'mad geneticist' continued to be a devastating player in the movie. He broke more than just innocent bodies with his sick and unethical experiments, he also traumatized their souls. Chukwudi Iwuji's riveting performance will not soon be forgotten.

On a lighter note, the movie contained a good amount of humor and hilarity. Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Star Lord's comedic timing was *chef's kiss*. Rocket Raccoon typically delivered the punchlines, but in this movie he had more dark and poignant moments than funny ones. I loved the way they balanced it all without compromising characterization value.

Everything about Counter-Earth was cleverly conceived and crafted. It evoked dark memories of what I'd seen in the 1996 movie ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (based on the novel by H. G. Wells).

The way Adam Warlock later turned good and helped save Peter Quill was a major highlight. Groot contributed some captivating moments as well. Most of the jokes in the movie were laugh-out-loud funny and the plot lingered in memory even after the end credits rolled.

Finally, the sheer empathy they wove around Rocket Raccoon in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" was nothing short of masterful. Needless to say, James Gunn certainly has the Midas touch.

"Great character endings, but mediocre film","Writing this as it's scoring arguably too highly at the moment and I don't want others big fans of the franchise to go in with high expectations that don't get met.

The film is not nearly as good as the original, or even as good as the second. However, the closing 20 minute sequence is great, there's another nice soundtrack, and Rocket's story is the highlight of the film.

The bad: the humour really doesn't hit anymore. There was flags in GOTG 2, but it all together doesn't work here. The same is true for the writing, it's not quite the same level.

I also can't help but feel the magic is slightly gone. The original was something we loved that we didn't know we wanted, it just isn't recaptured here. It's also just quite a messy film, so much CGI of strange concept creatures and places that focus on quantity rather than quality.

In my perspective, it's a continuation of the Phase 4 mediocreness that just can't capture the special something the Infinity Saga movies often had.",6/10,6 May 2023,tristanvmiles,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
The Best MCU Movie,"I believe that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is not only the best MCU film since ""Endgame"", but it's actually the best MCU film to date. I simply cannot understand why someone thought it was a good idea to fire James Gunn. It was a foolish decision. Gunn's creative vision and direction made this film an absolute masterpiece. The decision not to kill off any relevant characters was a smart one. It left everyone scattered throughout the galaxy, with each character on their own journey. For example, Peter is back on Earth with his grandpa. The High Evolutionary was a great villain and was perfectly suited to the storyline. This film was so emotional that it moved some viewers to tears, which is a testament to its quality.

We now have a new team, consisting of Rocket, Adam, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, and a female character whose name I do not know. I hope that we do not get a ""GOTG Vol. 4"" without James Gunn, as he is the only one who could write and direct a worthy follow-up to this perfect trilogy. The post-credit scene hinted that Star-Lord will return, which is sure to excite fans. I hope that we get to see an emotional scene in ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"" or ""Secret Wars"" where all of the Guardians (OG) reunite in a beautiful moment.

James Gunn ends his trilogy in a more brutal and dark way.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie in the Marvel movie series. This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.

Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.

In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.

With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.

For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.

In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.

The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character. This may be a bit disappointing for fans of the character.",7/10,4 May 2023,movieman6-413-929510,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Underwhelming,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.

The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.

A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.

The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.

The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.

Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.

Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.

The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.

The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?

All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.

At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).

Perfect ending,"This movie became my favourite one the moment the lights in the movie hall turned on.

Everything about it is just so good. The humour is top tier; the whole theater was laughing in unity. The imagery and sound system were amazing (I'm referring to the fact that you completely fell like you're part of the movie). The storyline is very exciting, I often found myself gripping the chair and it made my cry a few times.

There are two things that especially stood out to me: the soundtrack (ofc, one of the main reasons why I love the GOTG series so much), and the evolution of the caracters. I loved how we could really see their development, which sometimes took me by a complete surprise and I didn't feel like there was something missing from the movie.

All in all, thank you James Gunn and everyone for this masterpiece! If I had more money, I'd spend it all in the movies seeing this over and over again, because seeing it once is definitely not enough, you just wanna keep watching.",10/10,3 May 2023,hemilia,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Perhaps the greatest addition to the MCU since End Game,"I went in with mixed expectations. I'm a huge fan of the MCU; however, some of the phase 4 content had been disappointing. Guardian's of the galaxy volume 3, on the other hand, was one of Marvel's best productions yet! It had:

Great character development through the exploration of a certain characters backstory.


Hilarious interactions between the guardians thanks in part to the witty script writing.


Emotion. Legit straight up emotion. I was sat in the seat feeling the highest of heights during the fantastic fight sequences and a mere moment later I'm almost in tears.


In short: Go and see this movie, you will not regret it!",9/10,4 May 2023,ycxsdhswjs,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
"A perfect, perfect ending","I'll be the first to say I loathe and detest what Marvel's turned into over the last few years. But this was up there with the very very best. A perfect way to send off characters we've grown to love and adore over most of the last decade.

It could have easily been by-the-numbers but it has real emotional depth, adds some great new characters in, but most importantly gives the characters a proper end to their arcs.

You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll think ""No!"" and ""Yes!"" Naturally the soundtrack adds a lot too - similar to the last two Guardians film, it's an eclectic mix of music - some of which really hits the spot.

So yeah. James Gunn, thank you! You gave your creations a perfect send-off. Thanks mate x.

What an emotional rollercoaster of a finale,"I'm still trying to process it all 4 hours after sitting through it. I really couldn't have asked for a better send-off to each and every one of these characters who feel like friends. Every single Guardian got their moment to absolutely shine, even Cosmo & Kragler. Essentially the film was undoubtedly Rockets. The Rocket backstory was disturbing, hard to watch at times but absolutely beautiful too and I'd never have imagined a cynical 53 year old like myself shedding a tear at the cinema and being 1000 invested into the 4 friends story.

Once again, James Gunn has been stalking my Spotify and Apple Music accounts as he has continued to feature my very favourite songs from the 70's and 80's and now 90's and beyond haha. The choice of track for the big battle scene was as iconic as Led Zep's immigrant song for Thor Ragnarok.

Absolutely brilliant from start to finish and 2 and a half hours buzzed by in what seemed to be 30 minutes.. I'd have stayed in the cinema for another few hours too.

JG thank you so much.. you absolutely knocked it out of the park for me 10/10.",10/10,3 May 2023,mojavesky69,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Too long and sad,"Liked seeing some of Rocket's backstory but they went back so many times it got too depressing and disturbing. Bringing back Gamora went nowhere and felt pointless. Groot is all grown up and no longer cute or funny. The High Evolutionary was so despicable I don't know why his minions didn't take him out sooner! Why was Nathan Fillion wasted on such a minor and pointless character? Action scenes are excellent but there are too many and they're so long it becomes a bit mind numbing. Vol. 3 felt at least a half hour too long and lacked the uniqueness and fun of the first two movies. Lastly the soundtrack felt forced and not as integral as the first movie.

"What an ending, Florence the Machine I have no words","Was gonna give it a hard 8 but that last scene started and was crying with joy and felt those feel good goosebumps you get watching everything simmer down after the climax. What an ending what a movie! Not a masterpiece but certainly makes you feel something special hence the 9/10. It almost kept my attention for the duration of the movie. I felt it had a good mixture of weird but still made sense and did not become ridiculous (strictly speaking at how they conveyed the alien planets etc.) Soundtrack also was perfect. They hit every nail on the head. Thank you guardians, thank you Florence, thank you MARVEL!

"An ok MCU movie, a bad Guardians movie","To be perfectly honest, Im super burned out on the MCU by now. I had very little interest left except for this film. Having seen it, I'm still not quite sure how I feel.

The film is better than evrything else, film or TV, released ovwr phase 4 and 5. But still I found myself disappointed. The jokes, the constant arguing, the weird flesh planet... It all just tired me out this time.

Rockets storyline does its best to save this movie, but with a very messy ending and too many random moments, it wasnt enough for me to enjoy it. He is the only character they seemingly cared to write a decent storyline for, everyone else feels like theyre just there by obligation.

And Adam Warlock..... Dear lord. I dont see a point in saying it at this point but why adapt a character if thats what youre going to do? Literally unrecognisable and kind of insulting after all this time.

DIDN'T EXCEPT THAT TO BE THAT GOOD,"To be honest when I first watched the movie in the theatre I wasn't sure if it would be good. Like there is this thing that as more films are released for the trilogy it get worse and more bad, but in the guardians of the galaxy trilogy it's just ain't like that, every movie of the trilogy is good. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the third movie but then my friend forced me to come with him, and it was SO MUCH FUN I wa in shock when Sylvester Stallone came out of nowhere. But the movie was so funny and say and the action was also good and I had so much fun. I cried a lot during the movie but that's what make movie a good movie doesn't it? In my opinion of course, most of the movies I liked the most are the movies that I cried the most. In my opinion, when the movies gets me into a emotional mood they're good, 'cause I think action and fights it is not all about the movie, there need to be emotions in the movie who will make the people who watching the movie feel something. I think if the movie is just action and fight it is a little big boring, and I'm fan of action movies but there is need to be things that. Will evoke emotions in the crowd who watching the movie. In my opinion emotional scene in movies it is very important. And in conclusion, for those who haven't seen the movie, you absolutely should.",8/10,31 July 2023,vrpqqzxp,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Too long and too overstuffed but still an OK movie to see it once,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume"" 3 did not felt anything different from last movies made by Marvel - it's running time felt to long, it was overstuffed with plots, and homour was in its most scenes. I loved the first movie because it was so unique and fun, but this one while OK film to see it once didn't left me impressed. There was a great segments involving Rockets past (no spoilers), and i liked the villain for the most part, but sometimes less is better, and for this movie more tight plot could worked better.

Overall, 3rd part was better for me then the 2nd one, but felt short from how good the first movie was. An enjoyable movie to see it once but nothing more.

"So much to say - overall, I'm disappointed","It would have been fitting if they had used Meatloaf's classic song ""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad"" for this movie because that's exactly what I was thinking when I walked out of the theater.

In and of itself, this 3rd installment has action, humor, and hits the feels hard. HOWEVER, I'm very sad to say I did not like it and felt extremely let down...and it's James Gunn and what he did so amazingly well in the first two films that is to blame. I enjoyed the first 2 so much that changing gears so dramatically just did me in. Whatever special sauce that went into the first 2 movies that made me feel so good was so glaringly withheld from Volume 3 that it just left me feeling empty.

The first two movies have the perfect balance of laughs, intensity, and music. It never went too far in any one direction. This movie on the contrary is dark...very dark...and it overshadows the feel of the film from beginning to end. After the first 20 minutes I thought, ""Boy I hope the rest of the movie isn't like this."" - but it was. Oh man was it ever. The tone of this movie is just so overwhelmingly different this time around. Gone is that ""fun"" teamwork feel that we've come to love so much. Gone is the crafty decision to not take the whole thing too seriously.

One of the film's biggest ironies is that even though they go to such great lengths diving into Rocket's back story that you actually miss out on enjoying the fun, wise-cracking, kick-ass character from the first 2 films because that persona is completely missing in Volume 3.

There are those occasions in film when the director breaks a very crucial, yet unspoken rule about a viewer's emotional bond and affinity with the characters. By choosing to not reunite Peter and Gamora (in what would have been a magical note to end on), I believe many viewers will be left unsatisfied. (And yes it is important sometimes to give the viewer what they want - especially if they have already been on this rollercoaster for so many years now.) Yes, I realize Gamora has no memory of her past but this film teased us with opportunities for a rekindled romance. To not bring them back together to me, was a crime.

I'm bummed out for my kids. They loved the first 2 movies and could handle the killing and violence pretty well because many times James Gunn brilliantly made killing bad guys FUNNY. There's no way on earth they could watch this movie. It's got too much sadness, too much torture, too much emotional damage, and it has parts that are just plain gross - like almost horror movie type grossness.

And what happened to the great music from the first 2 movies? Volume 3 has a few good songs but it's nowhere near the caliber of the first 2. Not even close.

Lastly, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. I felt like the big ship (or whatever that thing was of the High Evolutionary) was on fire for the last half of the movie. The film felt like it tried to end about 5 times.

::sigh:: It's time for me to go back to watching Volumes 1 and 2. Like I said, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad...

BEST GUARDIAN MOVIE EVER,"Ok when I stepped into the theater I was expecting to walk out listing to jams BUT I cried walking out because this movie shows the biggest emotion ever to movies I've seen this is no happy ending this is a action ending. Rocket it the main character who is dreaming about his childhood when he got hurt and is in the coma while Star lord and the other guardians try to help him. But the antagonist is the evolutionary who evolves things and wants to study rockets brain because he could solve something he could not. With Yondu coming back made me happy because he rocked in the last movie even though he is dead he is there. Star lord gives the guardians leader name to rocket at the end and leaves to live with his grandfather and at the end of the credit cut scene it says "" The legendary Star lord will return.""

The last ride of Marvel,"Let me start by saying I used to be a huge Marvel fan, which is why it was so devastating to see the quality and feel of the movies deteriorate over the last few years. And while I have been over Marvel for some time, I still had this movie sitting unwatched. I couldn't bear to see the Guardians get ruined like the rest. But I did finally watch it and it was great. It wasn't exactly the sendoff I wanted, but it was definitely a good one nonetheless. James Gunn did a nice job keeping true to his characters, and I give him a ton of credit. It made me feel the old Marvel magic for possibly the last time, and for that I say, I'm most sincere terms, thank you.

The Star Wars of this Generation,"We have been subjected to franchise upon franchise of half baked member berries and re-imaginings over the past years that something original and with heart is desperately needed.

The way Disney has treated Marvel and Star Wars is shocking and a rant for another place. But through the wreckage, James Gunn has somehow retained the heart of iconic directors such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

Finally after years of bland superhero movies and writers who care more about their personal agenda over storytelling, we have the third in the trilogy which should be known as the Star Wars of our generation.

Guardians of the Galaxy got side-lined in the larger Marvel project and didn't get the praise and promotion it deserved.

As a stand - alone trilogy, the James Gunn Guardians of the Galaxy is a wonder.

It has loveable characters, great action, compelling story and satisfying resolution.

This should have been a blockbuster of the year. Unfortunately, the poor Marvel movies that proceeded it created a general sense of Marvel underwhelming.

People who may have loved to se this in the cinema were apathetic because of the terrible movies produced since Disney got hold of the MCU.

Watch it. Love it. As a trilogy the Guardians of the Galaxy should become a loved phenomenon to sit along side Star Wars in our go-to Sci- fi action adventure movies.",9/10,28 July 2023,hexagongraphicsuk,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Guardian Of the Galaxy Review,"An amazing farewell to our guardians of the galaxy making the trilogy perfect and goated. The plot of movie is mostly focused around the character of rocket, his past life and high evolutionary. The movie amazingly shows the relationship between the guardians and there relation with rocket specially peter and rocket relationship. It's shows there struggle to save rocket through out whole movie and also shows how far have they come compare to the first movie. Just like a average marvel movie the color and aesthetic of the movie was vibrant for most of the places. As always the movie does includes comdey moment and to be honest they are actually good comdey moments that doesn't feel unnecessary or forced, but at the same time the movie does gets serious when it's needed.

Disappointing and uneven sequel,"I'm a fan of the Guardian movies. The first was fabulous , the second was fun, but the third -this was so uneven and the music was awful. The dialogue was very angry and went on and on, how can it be for kids or even teens?, I really disliked the negativity by Gamora and the Manta girl. Only a rating given of 6 by me and what happened to the whoever chose the music? I only recognizes 2 tunes. Some good scenes were outnumbered by a bunch of mediocre ones. Chris Pratt was good and I liked the development of the background of a few characters like Rocket. Gaps in continuity and storyline too. Wait on this to come to Netflix!

Last Dance,"A tremendous closure of the MCU's best and most consistent trilogy. Great fun, with insane action and doses of classic Guardians heart & soul! It will leave you emotionally shattered, but filled with so much hope and optimism.

First, The MVP of the movie and i will not be even exaggerating when i say the whole trilogy, Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it.

Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around.

Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.

Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.

Groot is just Groot that we love i will not say anything more.

I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much Nevertheless, Im excited to see him in the future.

Cosmo is a New addition to the family and what a Great one i loved it so much can't wait for the character future because Cosmo is great in the comics. On the other hand Nebula arc is one of the best arcs in MCU history that is all I'm going to say.

John Murphy Music shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more unique.

Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be an uneven film at times, but it remains touching and endearing, with a fascinating study of its characters. Overall, it's a fitting and satisfying conclusion to one of Marvel's most beloved franchises.",8/10,4 May 2023,A7medSalah,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Hoping This Movie Sways People to Protest Against Animal Experimentation,"The message regarding the cruelty and suffering of lab animals is loud and clear in this movie. As a decades-long animal rights activist, I really appreciate the educational merits of including that content in a blockbuster movie. Thank you, writers, for that.

I loved the first two Guardians of the Galaxy installments and have seen them each at least a few times. This one, though? All throughout viewing this, all I could think was: ""Well . . . I can't see myself ever watching this again.""

As other reviewers have pointed out, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 lacks the luster and humor of the first two movies. Sure, there are loads of terrifically innovative aliens in this one. Lots of action. A great deal of character exposition and the truly heartfelt theme re: how The Guardians have all learned to love and respect one another.

That said, I had a real problem with certain aspects. Remember the ""Tell"" in Mad Max 2, where all the little kids are gathered and the story is told, in a background of glimmering firelight, of how the adults left all the kids behind? A sort of modern day take on Aboriginal ""dreaming"" and storytelling/lore. I always hated that part of the MM movies. Really cringe-worthy. Feral kid and all of that. Gag.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 introduces a slew of tow-headed children into the story and . . . I'm guessing the writers thought this would make the movie more appealing to kids and parents with kids? All I know is ---- ugh. Just seemed to be stuck in there, plot-wise, and to serve no purpose whatsoever. Joob joob. Weren't the Ewoks saying that in some Star Wars flick?

And the cosmonaut dog was just plain lame. The only good thing about that character was how it showed people that calling their dog a ""bad dog"" isn't a nice way to treat your dog. (Always praise your dog, at every opportunity.)

Okay. I'll stop now. I'm severely disappointed in this movie. And I did look up those insane tweets that James Gunn posted. Hollywood certainly can be forgiving. That dude is one creepy guy.

Perfection,"For a long time, the guardians resonated with me the most in the MCU. Given the amazing previous two movies, this third installment had a lot to live up to and it gave me everything I could have wanted and more. Guardians of the galaxy volume 3 pushes the boundaries of an average marvel movie and hits you with an emotional punch that will long with you even if you aren't a marvel fan or just watching these movies for fun. The characters are well written, well performed and this works greatly too as a final send off to these characters. The CGI was great too and so was the score. It not the type of marvel movie you have come to expect and I encourage everyone to give it a chance. It packs one big emotional punch.

"It's alright, but, overall, a very disappointing experience","I liked it alright for the most part, but man oh man was I disappointed. Why am I hearing all this stuff about it being ""the perfect send off for the team"", ""profoundly gut wrenching"" and ""Gunn's masterpiece"" et cetera et cetera et cetera?? It has some emotional moments for sure, but nothing that comes even remotely close to the send off that Yondu received in the second installment or ""We are Groot"" from the first. This movie felt very much the same as Thor Love and Thunder in that it seemed to just keep pushing jokes out at us indiscriminately, hoping some of them would stick. It did have its moments for sure, but it all just felt so contrived. Also, the VFX were not good...on par with everything Marvel's been doing as of late...everything just looks so cartoonish, not a hint of practical effects or an attempt to try to anchor the cartoon to reality. I'm also just not really into Marvel's style of camp and its commitment to emulating (homaging?) 60s style sci-fi television. All of the Dr. Seuss styled, purple faced, geometric haired people just seem so lazily designed and constructed...it all just fell a little flat for me.

There was a lot I did like. There were some good emotional beats, especially surrounding Rocket's arc. I just generally love these characters and Gunn is always able to squeeze tears out of me. The scene where Nebula first hears Rocket's voice over the com-link wrecked me. Karen Gillan positively nailed that scene.

My biggest issue, however, was with the end. There ended up being absolutely no stakes in this movie at all. I just don't understand how they could've done that. With Gunn's exit and the commitment to an entirely new Guardians team, the decision to feign and manipulate some kind of an emotional response instead of actually bringing some real emotional capital to the table was just a major faux pas. So disappointing.

A misfire. Think Hangover 3,"This was hard to watch. Loved the first two. This was a misfire in every way. Bad plot, poor song choices, chaotic action scenes. Worst movie I've seen in quite some time. I wish it wasn't the case, but James Gunn lost his way here. I didn't see anyone else too happy with the movie either. Not sure who's leaving the positive reviews. I wanted to leave halfway through. It's that bad! I suggest going to see dungeons and dragons instead. That movie was funny and actually made sense. The villian in guardians 3 is weak. The actor just screams every line. There's a dog that has superpowers. It's that bad.

Brilliant Trilogy,"This was such a breath of fresh air in terms of Marvel films. Like a lot of fans, really felt they were losing their interest and enjoyment but of course Guardians does not disappoint.

This is hands down the funniest marvel film, never laughed so much (of course it was silly at times but you'd expect that from a guardians film) The action sequences were fantastic and the CGI was great (first time in a while for a marvel film). Music was awesome and every character had their scene and whilst I was expecting some emotional scenes based from the trailer, there were a lot more. Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy .The only things I can criticize was the length and one particular character. Other than that this is a brilliant film and conclusion to a trilogy.

Edit: upon watching it the 2nd time and in Imax I've changed my rating from a 9 to a 10. My previous negatives I retract, the length is actually fine because the pace and plot suit it. The development of a character that I didn't like, I was wrong about seeing as this time I understood what gunn was doing. This is also the first time I've ever watched a film again in the cinema and man was it worth it!",10/10,3 May 2023,burntoutboy,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Emotional Wholesome Violence,"This film had everything I've been looking for in a Marvel film for so long. The film from start to end kept me enticed , it had it all, Comedy, Action, suspense. This volume introduced a lot of new characters like the lovable badass Adam Warlock and also had large character development on people we already love and know. But I must add this film had scenes which get you pumped with adrenaline and make you think to yourself ""that was sick af"" which a lot of Marvel films have been lacking recently.

Now when it comes to graphics and CGI this film did not fall short , expect to be blown away by the amazing cinematography. All in all I'm going to give this film a 8.5 out of 10, this is a review straight out of the cinema by the way just for context.

"Good, Satisfying Conclusion","If you're reading this you've already invested some time (and emotion) watching the first two.

As a conclusion to the original trilogy (there will be more Starlord) it does a pretty good job. The lengthy backstory and character arc for Rocket is great. Gamora's piece is good also. The evolution of Nebula continues with a new look and more sensitive outlook.

The one character I didn't enjoy was Adam. If you've read the original Genesis of this character, he was never ""half-baked"" and goofy. He was more like The Silver Surfer, a demigod. Because this version of Adam is so dumb and clumsy, there's little tension in the fight scenes he's involved in except for his first appearance where we don't see him verbally engage with other characters.

The weakness in the film is the extended second act. Nathan Fillion is always fun, but the antics in the organic space station go on too long. And as cute as it was, the freeing of all the children at the end felt contrived.

Nonetheless, recommended for all of the above and the uplifting ending to a fun story of a band of misfits.",8/10,16 September 2023,TMAuthor23,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
"Best MCU experience in a while, a long while","I'll keep this review short and simple. Aside from some awkwardly silly jokes and (only sometimes) slightly confusing pace, this was the best installment from the GOTG series. For the first time in a very long while, I really got 'pulled' in to the movie emotionally, something that hasn't happened since ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". Since this review requires more ""characters"" I'll just add that GOTG 3 was a perfect finale to the series and I'm looking forward to the ""New Guardians"" (or whatever name they'll be referred to). With all of that being said, Guardians Vol. 3 is, without a doubt, one of the best MCU movies, definitely in the top 5 and well worth the price of admission.

Eeesh,"I was SO looking forward to seeing this. Then reading all the rave reviews and high ratings only elevated my expectations. Maybe that was the problem.

I loved the ending. The soundtrack, of course(!!), was phenomenal. Cameos and the return of past characters added some fun satisfaction.

All of those positives and I *still* stand by my very unpopular opinion...the first hour and forty minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3 were boring as hell. It was so disappointing. I was not the only in the theatre who had a ""long blink."" The man next to me snored out loud. When his wife gave him a tap, she said, ""I'm dozing off, too...""

Once into the final 40-45 minutes stretch, however, it's pure galaxy fun! The dog days are over. :-)

Loss and Love,"Wow !

By far the best entry into the Guardians movies and up there with some of the best Marvel movies in general. The story isn't at all what I guessed from the trailers but as spoiler free as I can, a guardian gets injured and the rest of the guardians must band together to help save their life.

We get the backstory of Rocket and it's heartbreaking, the high evolutionary is one of the meanest we have seen in the movies. He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.

The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.

Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !!

The stakes are high, the heart is felt, tears swelled and overall I had a fantastic time, the perfect ending to one of Marvels best trilogy.",8/10,3 May 2023,eoinpgeary,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Long on nonsensical action short on story,"This is not a good movie.

The characters have become boring.

Drax is dull and uninteresting.

Nebula has evolved from her intense core to a diluted run of the mill character.

Peter Quill is Pastiche of superheros we have seen before.

Gamora becomes a running joke.

The movie makes too many self referential jokes that seem both cruel and breaks the magic of the movie.

Ridiculous endless boring battles are waged.

The whole plot revolves around a tediously boring mcguffin that sidelines one of the franchises best characters.

The outline of the plot is a rehash of the main idea from GotG II. We see trope after trope doled out that we are numb to the original shock value.

And then there is the moral hogwash were one minute some people need a second chance while others are mowed down in droves for humor value.

And then the whole christian appeal to evangelicals or whoever.

In summary all the worst elements of Marvel movies rolled into a how to movie on how to bore your audience to death.

Oh did I mention not one catchy tune?

Simply not worthy of the GotG franchise.",6/10,6 May 2023,prometheusone,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
Undoubtedly best after no way home,"Love this heartwarming movie! James gives all fans a fun, stunning, insane and heart moving two and half hours. The MVP must be Rocket, one of best well-developing character in MCU movie. His sad backstory is the core of this movie, which made me cry for four talking animal. The relationship between Nebula, past Gamora and Starlord is also interesting, so does the chemistry between Mantis and Drax. Groot and Cosmo also put laughter in this cute movie. However, High evolution just like Kang in Ant man 3, lack of character development, and being annoying and irritating. However, it can't stop me from loving this movie. Go buy the ticket and hanging out the last time with Guardians of galaxy!

Satisfying Conclusion To A Trilogy,"It starts with one of those free-for-all battles in which Rocket J. Squirrel.... I mean Raccoon is badly injured. When they try to fix him using high tech, it turns out that they need to get a special computer key, otherwise he'll die. So we alternate between part of his origin story -- although not how he picked up that old-line Bensonhurst accent -- and the various characters in the franchise doing stuff, slanging each other, for 130 minutes. Chukwudi Iwuji is the big villain, who starts off sounding like a high-minded fellow, conducting interesting experiments in eugenics, although by the end we can be sure he'll be just another loon who needs to be shredded into little pieces so that cute little girls can be safe.

We also get a sense that this phase of the Guardians is at an end, with several of them going off to do their own things, while Rocket works with a revised team who haven't heard all his wisecracks before. It's a satisfying conclusion to this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with what my cousin assures me is a good selection of pop music from the 1980s through 2010. For those who care about such things, Nathan Fillion has a nice small role, and his TV daughter from CASTLE, Molly C. Quinn, plays one of the Ravagers.

Not as good as the first two. Bizarre and depressing.,"I know that I have a minority opinion here so go ahead and rip me for it.

ANALYTICAL BREAKDOWN There are too many instances of characters shouting over each other in this film. The characters do not appear to have any intelligent conversions. At all. Like seeing people argue in a homeless camp or a subway. I can't believe this. It comes off very depressing.

The first two movies were fun. The first was the best and the second was only slightly less great. But this one? It's tone is all over the place. One minute its goofy and the next we are seeing animal cruelty. Drax is easily the most entertaining character. By far. The other ones were just acting like children all of the time they weren't fighting.

The music was the worst of all three films. Predictable. Boring. The villain was also one-dimensional. Rocket's story is just too depressing for this type of film series that used to be about having fun. This is really bad.",5/10,18 May 2023,baconc-35672,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),NEGATIVE
A really good send off to beloved characters,"It had a basic story but the execution was fabulous, the villain was a great (finally a evil villain) the characters were all the highlight of this movie because since the first one, it has become clear that James Gunn can take lesser known characters and make them a household name and the send off is not the best but a great way to send off this franchise. The best character and the best part about this movie is rocket. The flashbacks are very interesting and compelling shows his backstory shows how the villain became how he is in this movie. Each character has moments to shine and it's very well mannered.

A brilliant send-off to the beloved Guardians,"I cannot stress how absolutely ecstatic to say that there may just be hope for Marvel. It's true what critics say when it's the best thing since Endgame. An absolutely magnificent roller-coaster of action, story and emotion. There is a huge ensemble cast with several newcomers to the franchise, which have have been mostly well balanced in their introductions, although can leave a little more to be desired. However our returning Guardians all have wonderful stand-out moments throughout, and Gunn's love for the characters and storytelling really shine. A great last hurrah to the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a definite must-watch for every single Marvel fan!

P. S. I love that James Gunn gave a special thanks ""To the fans!"" in the end credits. Absolutely cannot wait for what Gunn and his crew bring to the DCU!

Best Marvel Movie made for those who are family starved!,"I never related so well to a movie like I did with this one! Volume 3 had me so emotional but it felt great! It was so beautiful to see how much each character cared about one another! How they considered one and other family without being actually related to each other, this part just made me cry so much! The storyline was just wonderful and relatable in a not all family is blood family type of way! I loved it! I'm adopted, so it's always great to see movies that hit home. Family sticking together is the best way to be in real life too! Thank you for such a great film! I hope there's a film for every character in the movie!

Prepare for one hell of a ride...,"I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.

This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.

What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.

The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.

The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.

Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.

The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.

Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.",8/10,3 May 2023,ethanbresnett,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Great Marvel Movie!,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the third installment and the final movie in the trilogy. I haven't seen the previous movies, but it wasn't much you got to understand from the previous, what was good about it. Great space adventure, that shows us the moral of that you should not harm people and animals, and that teamwork and friendship is important. This time we got more flashback from Rockets past, Rocket The Raccoon was a experiment for the perfect society, but the villain didn't want to make things perfect, he just hated the things the way the were. Rockets flashbacks and experiments was heartbreaking and very emotional moments, that almost made me cry. His friends, the other Guardians, tried to save him in this movie, because Rocket was about to die, and his flashbacks come. The movie were great directed by James Gunn. They made a generic plot in an interesting way. Funny dialogues, sometimes confusing, but that is what made it funny. Great visuals and scenography, and I really got the space adventure feeling. Beside of Rocket, I liked some of the other characters, like Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, he was funny and you could almost think that he really was a guardian. Cosmo the space dog was funny, not so important but made the movie. I think if Cosmo wasn't included, I would give this movie 7/10, not 8/10. Groot don't speak too much, and he is not the best character, but acceptable. When Guardians travelled between the planets, it flows really smooth and the planets were very detailed so you got a lot of information from each planet, what made me understand more of the planet's perspective and the people that lived there. I think they presented the moral of friendship and family in the movie. From Rockets flashbacks we can learn that harming others is bad, and that freedom is important. You can learn a lot, a movie full of moral and value. If you like Marvel movies, then you should watch it. If you like space adventures and funny dogs, this movie is highly recommended. Well done, James Gunn did a good job, one of the best Marvel movies of the year, much better than Ant-Man in Quantamania.

A perfect ending to an unbelievable trilogy 👏🏼,"Just come of the cinema and I am gobsmacked! This movie hits all the notes and is a genuine rollercoaster of emotions.

The feeling, the aesthetics, the soundtrack, the humour all work in unison wonderfully, alongside a story which spends most of its time focussing mainly on Rocket's backstory as well as moving forward for our heroes. I simply cannot wait to watch it again.

I laughed, I cried (3 times) and I was blown away. The action sequences completely land (especially the scene with the Beastie Boys - No Sleep Til Brooklyn backing track).

This movie is absolute perfection. A genuinely delightful end to a superb trilogy. Bravo James Gunn and thank you the Guardians of the Galaxy 🙌🏼

How MARVEL Films Were and Should Be,"To be honest I am disappointed I did not get a chance to see this in theaters. Just finished on Disney+ Guardians 3 IS one of the best MARVEL films and IS the best MARVEL film since Endgame.

The story expands on the Guardians even more and does it without the comedy aspect overpowering the base narrative. All while carrying a steady pace between story, action, etc. Sadly a lot of the phase 4 MARVEL films and TV series went the route of comedy over narrative, and it shows. Here Guardians 3 includes the emotional aspect where it not only sticks with you but also has the factor where you can re-watch and enjoy seeing those moments again. I go back to re-watching the MCU in phase 1 through 3, but Phase 4 I have little interest in re-watching with the exception of a couple TV series. This does include some sensitive material, and may not be for everyone. Sensitive material is hard to watch, overcoming it to see where it goes I feel is a reward in itself here and Gunn delivered.

Guardians 3 feels like the MARVEL producers, higher ups did not heavily influence it and let James Gunn do his work. If you are looking to get that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania taste gone I HIGHLY suggest watching Guardians 3.",9/10,6 August 2023,nemesis2000-2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
I don't understand the hype,"You have to be either a child or someone who does not understand the depth of our world to enjoy this movie. Mindless brain rot desperately trying to make you feel something. I love marvel I really do. And if you care about these characters I get it. But you've got to take off those rose colored glasses and understand that the billionaires controlling these movies don't care. It's obvious how shallow and insignificant everything they write for these movies is. No more in any marvel movie is there a sense of danger or achievement or anything of that regard. Not so long as the multiverse exists. And this could have been fixed probably if the producers cared enough to address it, which they don't. Shallow, synthetic, and unapologetically pulling your heart strings to distract you from the lack of substance or anything of any meaning. Even the action scenes which previously have distracted the masses from the glaring blandness and dullness are derivative and uniquely boring to watch. No artistic creativity, offers nothing new and is an insult to the comic universe.

One of the best films of the new phase for Marvel.,"Guardians Vol. 3 delivers what many newer Marvel movies have been lacking of late. Granted, we are presented with characters which we have grown to love so that puts this film at an advantage. However, the most recent installment added to character's depth and continued on storylines created in the previous phase. For this reason, Guardians Vol. 3 stands as one of Marvel's better films. The most striking thing to me is the emotion and feeling the animators and Bradley Cooper were able to bring to a CGI character like Rocket. Honestly one of the more moving performances I've ever seen from voice acting and animation alone. The film left me satisfied as a conclusion to this three-part story. As usual with this franchise, the soundtrack was phenomenal. The comedic performances and the action sequences were all on par with the previous films as well. Some newer characters (Adam Warlock) felt underwhelming but this didn't take away from the overall story. In fact, I loved Poulter's performance and found it quite funny, but the character himself felt unnecessary in the overall story. The villain, The High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji, was one of my favorite villains in the MCU to date.

Overall, this film should be a delight to anyone who has grown to love the Guardians franchise. If you're not into the MCU films then this probably won't change your view. Otherwise, you will be happy to see the familiar faces and a film that lives up to the high bar that Marvel has set for itself, something a lot of the newer films have failed to do.",7/10,27 December 2023,Jarmfield55,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),POSITIVE
Slowly loosing patience and hope,"Marvel seems to be making contest for the ugliest world created in its movies. The world in the latest Ant Man looks like fungus under the microscope. While the world in this one is full of weird creatures that look like they were taken from this H. G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr Moreau'. The movie is weak. Definitely the weakest of all three Guardians of Galaxy movies. I guess it was supposed to be emotional. But it's not. It fails even there, because all these creatures are so grotesque. It still has good music though, but that's the only plus I can think of. Also, why is Gamora even there? She died god damn it. But sure, in sci - fi it's not a problem, let's just tell the viewers that the new Gamora is from the parallel universe. Of course I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. She's incredibly talented and so cute. But she shouldn't be there.

And of course this overblown 8,3 rating. No this, movie is not 8,3. It's not even 3. I don't know what is happening with Marvel but still not even one good movie since Avengers Infinity War / Endgame.

"An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",10/10,1 April 2019,andrewburgereviews,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
One of the best of all time.,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.",10/10,6 February 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE

The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!,"'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.

Amazing movie,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia.

"Another kind of ""family movie""","The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.

The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.

But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.

As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.

The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.

However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.

To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.

I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.

There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.

The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.

The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.

"""The Godfather"" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.

An Iconic Film,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.

The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, ""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.

"Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.

2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).

3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.

All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.

I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

"#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",10/10,30 March 2013,planktonrules,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Everything you've ever heard is true...,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",10/10,1 April 2014,Leofwine_draca,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've,"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

Absurdly overrated,"I'm sure it was good for its time, but by todays standard this is truly mediocre. It's 3 hours of boredom, cheesy stereotypical dialog, and unrealistic mafia. Some of the sub plots, like the 30 minute Sicilia sequence, with Michael marrying this girl we have never seen before, only for the movie to kill her off 20 minutes later, before we've even heard her talk? One of the most useless sub plots I have ever seen in any movie. Did they expect us to care for her after introducing her 20 minutes ago, and not even giving her a proper line to say? Movie should have well under 2 hours and at the end of the day was a borefest.

"An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World","""The Godfather"" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared.

The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me.""

We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been.

The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.""

That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted bastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like ""The Godfather,"" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.

This Movie Has Haunted My Life...,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

A Masterpiece,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Magnificent portrait of organized crime,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..

Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.

This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece.

The Geatest Movie Ever Made,"You can't really criticize a film like ""The Godfather"", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, ""The Godfather"" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen ""The Godfather"" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.

Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.

There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a ""Moustache"" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.

The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.

The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. ""The Godfather"" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.

If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.

Overall, ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words ""required viewings.""

perfect,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

Not sure,"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.

The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.

But i never get into it.

The plot is ok but i wanted more.

I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.

They just ""looked"" and there was silence.

I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".

I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.

The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.

Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.

For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.

I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.",7/10,13 June 2022,Clumsy14,The Godfather (1972),NEGATIVE
I don't get the hype.,"I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.

It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Worth a watch but don't get too excited.

Top 5,"One of the great movies of its time. Before, and even now is admire as one of the most classic and greatest films of all time. And I agree. I remember when I first watched it I never thought that Sonny would be the one killed, and Michael being the one taking over the family, and ruling with an iron fist. I have to watch at least one or two times a year.

How things were done back then!,"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

The world inside the underworld!,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy",10/10,4 July 2005,vjeet_a,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
One of the all time greatest,"There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale.

The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!

Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective.

Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances.

The Godfather make me an offer that I cannot refuse. This movie is a masterpiece.,"It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.

Perfection,"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema,"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don.

The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.

The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder.

The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era.

If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny.

This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema.

Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia.

Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.

Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10

The Godfather,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.

Great look at a family based around crime,"Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs. Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low. When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.

The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made. The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time. It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.

Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout. The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.

Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too. Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time. The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages. Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.

In every area the film oozes class and professionalism. The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.

Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more. Now that's respect.

Count Me In The Minority,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.

I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.

The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"Has its moments, but not the best film","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

The Don And His Sons,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

In fact it's all beautifully played.",10/10,9 March 2008,bkoganbing,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
an unforgetable film,"This movie alongside Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Godfather:part II, The Third Man and Lawrence Of Arabia is my absolutely favorite film. Some scenes you just can't forget. Vito's character is one of the best played roles in movies history (done by Marlon Brando). This story about Corleone family (together with part 2 and 3) is the greatest movie epic ever made.

Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've,"I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.

The GODFATHER what else can i say ?,"The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).

"One of the best of all timeA masterclass in filmmaking,","The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.

Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.

The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.

With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.

This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10.",10/10,4 July 2024,athenlyre,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Classic,"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.

The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.

The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.

The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.

A powerful and unforgettable film achievement.",10/10,19 January 2021,dk777,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.,"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.

Good but overhyped,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.

For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.",7/10,24 November 2020,briancham1994,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
I can honestly say that it's overrated,"The day before yesterday I decided that I should watch The Godfather since it's pretty much a movie that one would have to see during his lifetime, but I was very disappointed. I thought that it would be a great movie with a plot that would be interesting, characters that I could relate to and give me some form of entertainment during the course of the movie, but boy was I wrong.

I was pretty much bored from the start to the end of the movie and the only reason why I kept watching was because I thought to myself ""This is a movie everyone must have seen during their lifetime"". It even took me two days to watch it because I was so bored that I paused the movie and went to bed and continued to watch it the day after and was still just as bored.

The acting was okay at best and I felt that the actors could have done better but failed to do so, and the director failed to even get me interested in the characters. When some of the characters die I didn't care one bit, not once did I care. They could have killed everyone in the movie and I wouldn't care at all because I could not relate to anything of the characters persona.

Due to the lack of character-interest I didn't get interested in the plot at all and it felt like I was dragged through the whole movie with a barbwire around my neck.

Today I plan to get dragged once more when I'm going to watch The Godfather 2 and if it's anything like the first one it's going to be a horrible experience.

There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say.

A genre-defining masterpiece,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.

Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.

Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.

Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.

So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.

An all-time classic.",10/10,20 December 2015,grantss,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
A Legitimately Perfect Film,"Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?

Everything about this movie is perfectly executed and incredibly well put together. The characters are really what added that extra depth to the film. The first character I want to bring up is Sonny. Throughout the movie, you know him as an ignorant and almost childish person, yet when he is shot and killed, you feel immediate sympathy for him. And at the same time he is a determined member of their family business and also caring when the time is needed for that trait to be exposed (ex: when Vito nearly dies in the first act). And when Vito is looking down at his dead body, you really feel for them even though someone like Vito may come across like an incredibly serious and emotionless man. But what they accomplished was, not making him another one dimensional Mafia/mob boss, but someone who legitimately cares for his family. The way they introduce him in the beginning of the film is very well conducted and shows the audience how intimidating he is and the impact he has on other people in what he says and how his word/opinion is extremely important to people. Brando is incomparable in his role and is irreplaceable as his role as Don Corleone.

My favorite aspect of this movie, however, is seeing the riveting transition of Michael Corleone throughout the film. They first introduce Michael as someone who wants nothing to do with the family business, but is eventually the new Don replacing his father at the end of the film. Wow! What a transformation! He is a former Marine who is committed to living a normal, happy life with his wife Kay. However Michael eventually gets involved in the criminal empire after Vito is shot and almost killed. This leads up to the best scene, in my opinion, of the movie. Michael goes out to a restaurant with Sollozzo, the head of one of the rival families of the Corleones, the Tattaglias, in addition to Police Captain McCluskey, with intentions to kill both of them. He does after contemplating it in his head, and this is an incredibly important scene because it is the start of Michael's transition into the new Don we see at the end of the movie. It was not rushed in any way and that's another great aspect of the film. It's nearly three hours long, but it's necessary for the person watching it to be fully immersed into the story and characters. The ending is really well directed and thought out because without any explanation, you know what just happened as soon as someone kisses Michael's hand, which was shown earlier in the film but to Vito, a gesture only given to the Don. Al Pacino gave a great performance and so did every single other person in the movie. Perfect casting all around.

I think one performance that is very undervalued is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He plays a super important role in the movie, but is not quickly thought of by most people. He was a side character, but incorporated well in the film as the advisor for Vito, and later Michael.

Many Of the characters in the movie and constantly conflicted with themselves and they display it very well. The entire story is one of the best ever put to the big screen and the praise that it's gotten over all these years are very deserving.

The way they utilize lighting in the film is also very important such as every scene of Vito in his office at the beginning of the film is constantly lit dark showing the fear people feel when entering his office and the seriousness of situations involving him. This also applies to Vito's soft spoken voice demonstrating how intimidating he comes off as without screaming for example. A vast majority of the film, basically the entire 2nd and 3rd acts, with the exception of the very beginning with the wedding to go also how with the 1st act, are all lit dim, in dark tones. On the other hand, Michael, in the beginning of the film, is shown in the bright daylight outside talking with his girlfriend, an excellent contrast between him and the rest of his family.

Great acting, great script, and all put into great hands that made it as amazing as it is even 40 years later.

RATING: 10.0/10

The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.",10/10,24 March 2015,crendine,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
"An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",10/10,1 April 2019,andrewburgereviews,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
One of the best of all time.,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

Amazing movie,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",10/10,22 January 2020,danielfeerst,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE

I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

"#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",10/10,30 March 2013,planktonrules,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Everything you've ever heard is true...,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",10/10,1 April 2014,Leofwine_draca,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've,"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

This Movie Has Haunted My Life...,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

A Masterpiece,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Not sure,"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.

The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.

But i never get into it.

The plot is ok but i wanted more.

I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.

They just ""looked"" and there was silence.

I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".

I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.

The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.

Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.

For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.

I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.",7/10,13 June 2022,Clumsy14,The Godfather (1972),NEGATIVE
I don't get the hype.,"I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.

It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Worth a watch but don't get too excited.

How things were done back then!,"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.

The world inside the underworld!,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy",10/10,4 July 2005,vjeet_a,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE

Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.

Count Me In The Minority,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.

I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.

The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""

It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.

"Has its moments, but not the best film","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.

The Don And His Sons,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

"One of the best of all timeA masterclass in filmmaking,","The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.

Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.

The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.

With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.

Classic,"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.

This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.

The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.

The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.

The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.

Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.,"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.

Good but overhyped,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.

For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.",7/10,24 November 2020,briancham1994,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE

A genre-defining masterpiece,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.

Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.

Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.

Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.

So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.

The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.",10/10,24 March 2015,crendine,The Godfather (1972),POSITIVE
One of the greatest,"Personally The Third Man is the best film ever, but this is up there. As innovative as Citizen Kane was, I'm gonna put this one ahead of it.

But in one way this film beats all others - the dialogue. Yes, the cinematography is great, the acting is second to none, but how many eternal lines of dialogue came from this? 'Here's looking at you, kid,' 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,' 'We'll always have Paris,' 'Round up the usual suspects,' 'The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world,' 'I'm shocked to find out that gambling is going on,' 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.

As much as I prefer a happy ending, I'm gonna go ahead and say the ending felt perfect. It had to go that way. I think I'll end by saying Humphrey Bogart just might be the most watchable actor in cinematic history.

With no other choice but to seek help from her ex lover Ilsa tries to persuade Rick to help Victor escape the german to America. I was infatuated by the performance of Ingrid Bergman who plays Ilsa. She was an absolute peach with her amazing yet painful dialogues. Casablanca will always be a monumental work in the history of the cinemas.

HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE,"There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB. Many of them exhort its greatness. I don't disagree with them.

But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film. I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.

The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted. The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more. Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.

So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.

Don't have a Casablaca party. Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch."" Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.

Buy this movie on DVD. Have it at the ready. And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.

The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism. Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses. As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world."" If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.

There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time. Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans. They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.

But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.

If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing. And that will be enough to start you on your way.

Happy viewing, kid.",10/10,23 August 2003,Jaymay,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"We'll always have ""Casablanca"" ...","A few movies managed to achieve such a legendary status. Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By'  ta-da ta-da ta-daaa  and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.

One word : ""Casablanca"", and a gallery of characters revives, Sam, the piano player, these unforgettable second-billed actors who graced the silver screen in these black and white days, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, an international cast and so many immortal scenes, Rick Blaine's bourbon-driven melancholy while remembering the good old days with Ilsa, the patriotic fervor expressed during the singing of La Marseillaise and probably the most emotional farewell scene ever, followed by ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as the ending of a beautiful movie. Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture : ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own. But still, everything would all have been secondary if it wasn't for THE element that made ""Casablanca"" such a legendary film : it's a beautiful romance.

60 years later, the movie still divides, should have Ilsa gone with Rick or Laszlo? The consensus is that she did the right choice, but there's no doubt that the truer love was Rick. The film perfectly captured the dilemma of a real triangular love as Ilsa's husband, Viktor Lazslo is fundamentally a good man, a heroic resistant fighter who escaped from a concentration camp, and the only man who inspired Rick Blaine a bit of admiration. As an ex-freedom fighter, Rick sure understands the value of courage and visibly, something from the past has metamorphosed his idealistic nature into the cynical and detached mask of a lone wolf figure. Who else than Humphrey Bogart could have played this role with such intensity? Intense but still profoundly romantic as the wound in Rick's heart opens when Lazslo comes back with Ilsa, Rick's former love, back then in Paris.

The international atmosphere of the Rick's Café nightclub gives it a unique and absolutely endearing flavor spiced up that pivotal night, when Ilsa asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By', we understand that this song has a poignant significance, as the last one she and Rick heard as lovers, before the War came and ruined everything. Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America. Rick exiled himself in Casablanca, as if something was unconsciously keeping him within the War, and when he delivers the legendary : ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" is he really lamenting? When Ilsa re-enters his life, his office, Rick's bitterness made him say the wrong words, but then he painfully realizes he still loves her, and that Lazlso took her from him.

Lazslo and Ilsa need two 'letters of transit' to go to Lisbon, and by an ironic coincidence, Rick got those two tickets from a suave criminal named Ugarte who got them by murdering two German couriers. With the death of Ugarte, the two tickets for freedom were in Rick's hand and a great moral dilemma in his heart : contributing to the War effort and lose the love or his life, or following his motto : ""I stick my neck out for nobody"". Rick's true nature can't fool anyone, but the romance gains in complexity when Ilsa revealing to Rick why she left him, reconciles with him and realizes she loves him more than ever and can't leave him again. The romance is in a dead-end, and compromised by the antagonistic presence of the Major Heinrich Strasser who can't allow Lazzlo to escape. Strasser counts on the collaboration of Vichy's government, incarnated by Captain Renault, another character we still don't know where his heart belongs to, as he said : ""This is my least vulnerable spot""

Ultimately, and I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring, as said Roger Ebert in his brilliant commentary, all the characters aren't bad people. Even the ambiguity of Captain Renault is a nice writing touch that allows to keep uncertain the role he's going to play, although the roulette episode proved his good heart. Even Greenstreet as the head of the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival accepts to buy him out and keep all the employees, even Yvonne, the French girl who dated a Nazi officer couldn't hide her tears when the Marseillaise was sung. Finally, the heroic nature of Rick Blaine prevailed as he decided to take care of everything, fooling Ilsa, Lazzslo, and Renault, but ultimately getting them in the plane. Renault also redeemed himself by the ""Round up the usual suspects"" to clear Rick of shooting Major Strasser before he could order to cancel the flight.

Rick, #4 hero in the American Film Institute, explains his decision to Ilsa : ""I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". He's twice wrong. First, Rick is excellent at being noble. Secondly, now that WW2 is over but not ""Casablanca""'s legendary status, whether you love old, classic, black and white films or not, you should ask yourself if the problems of three little problems aren't finally the essence of the most beautiful acts that humanity could inspire.

A masterwork for all time...,"There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover.

As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on.

Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.

The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him.

This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",10/10,10 November 2004,kdryan,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
The Fundamental Things Apply...,"""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.

It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.

Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.

""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.

For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.

But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.

My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.

It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.

Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world.",10/10,16 January 2005,slokes,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
We'll Always Have Casablanca,"Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?

I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.

But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").

But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?

About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.

So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.

So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!",10/10,29 March 2004,RWiggum,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Now I finally know why this one is one of the best,"Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.

"Of all the gin joints, in all the world...","Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio's death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir's idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman's heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.

But then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.

Meanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption 'a typical Jew' so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. 'Entree des artistes', a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio's scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.

After a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in 'Hold Back the Dawn', a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.

In early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.

Shooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.

They produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to 'Casablanca'.

It is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. 'We'll always have Paris', 'I was misinformed', 'Here's looking at you, kid', ' I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!', 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', 'Oh he's just like any other man, only more so', 'I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one', 'Round up the usual suspects', and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, 'Play it again, Sam'.

Madeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.

And when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, 'I'm shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!' the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, 'Your winnings, sir.' It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.

I have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.

Alas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.

Late in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply 'old man in whore house', in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what 'grand themes' may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival.",No rating,18 November 2005,mryerson,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Is it good? Yes. Is it overrated? Also yes.,"I was extremely skeptical when I put the video tape into the cassette player but I was pleasantly surprised by both my focus and the film. The picture was sharper than expected and luckily the film was not very long.

But quite honestly, I don't see what's so special about the movie. Not really my taste, but still! There are probably quite a few details that I didn't notice, but I don't think you should have to google ""why is Casablanca great"" to understand the hype surrounding the film.

Do not misunderstand me. It was good. It was actually very good from time to time. Stylish environments and lovely vibes. However, I think that the explanations for why the film is good are rather reasons why the film is even better than what you already thought. Should a film really require so much analysis and thought? Yes, a movie like this might need it.

I tried to see the film with an extra critical and objective eye. The plot is good, the characters are nuanced and many good questions are asked. The main character has had his heart broken and his ideologies have changed. It's an interesting premise. It's all good on paper and I imagine the film was a great when it came out during WWII. Can you imagine that? 80 years ago. There are people in this who were born in the 19th century. That is certainly interesting.

In conclusion, I was surprised that it was quite good, but I didn't really like it. It's undeniably a pretty good movie, but is it overrated? In my eyes? Yes, I would say so. Is it just because of the outdated technology? No, the plot wasn't very complex and the moral dilemma the whole thing was about is nowhere near groundbreaking today. Maybe it was 80 years ago but how do I know.",7/10,9 March 2023,lovemichaeljordan,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"A story that will never get tired, incredible film.","American in Casablanca, Rick Blaine holds the fate of his former lover Ilsa Lund and her husband, who's trying to flee The Nazis.

I've just watched this film for the very first time, and I plan to watch it again on Christmas morning, before the events of the day start.

What an enchanting, magical experience this couple of hours of viewing was, true screen greats bringing to life a magical story.

Casablanca is not what I was expecting, it's a war film with a twist, a story seen through the eyes of people fortunate to escape Europe, it's a love story, with a difference.

The characters are captivating, they all feel very real, a mix of hope and fear etched over their faces, a harsh reality to all of them, none of them are syrupy sweet or sentimental, you feel a true sense of desperation.

Ingrid Bergman's finest hour, a gracious beauty, her presence is quite enchanting, Bogart delivers a superb performance, the presence of the pair is quite something, the whole cast are terrific.

Amazing to think that this was made in the middle of The Second World War, indeed I believe several of The German characters, were German Jews who had fled The Nazis.

A timeless classic,"""Casablanca"" remains one of the most iconic films in cinematic history, with its timeless story of love, sacrifice, and intrigue set against the backdrop of World War II. Starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the film weaves a compelling narrative filled with memorable dialogue and unforgettable moments.

Bogart's portrayal of Rick, a jaded nightclub owner in Vichy-controlled Casablanca, is both nuanced and magnetic. His chemistry with Bergman's Ilsa, a woman from his past who unexpectedly reappears, is electric and forms the emotional core of the movie. Their reunion sparks a series of events that highlight themes of loyalty, duty, and moral ambiguity.

The supporting cast, including Claude Rains as the charming yet shrewd Captain Renault, adds depth and color to the story. The film's direction by Michael Curtiz is masterful, creating a rich, atmospheric setting that enhances the narrative's tension and romance.

Despite being released in 1942, ""Casablanca"" remains relevant and poignant, demonstrating the enduring power of well-crafted storytelling and character development. While some might find its pace reflective of its era, ""Casablanca"" is a cinematic treasure that continues to captivate audiences with its timeless appeal.",6/10,3 June 2024,Falko_h1,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
The Sixth Greatest Film Of All Time ????????,"First off, I'm going to say this once and make it very clear. If you liked ""Casablanca"" and though it was a work of ""sheer brilliance"" than that's fine. Hence the old saying ""each to his own"". If you didn't like it, then I agree with you.

Now before you snobs critically abuse, hear me out. I saw nothing in it that was deserving of the title ""epic"". Now I am not one of those ignorami who hate movies made before 1970. Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.

Sure, you ""Cinematic Elite"" may like it, but is ""Casablanca"" really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema. I wanted to like the film (I really did), but I'm not going to pretend I liked it just because all of you fellow critics admired it.

Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman,"Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++",10/10,30 November 2004,smatysia,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"""It seems destiny has taken a hand.""","This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's ""King Kong"". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.

It's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.

I'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.

All the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.

One cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen ""Casablanca"".",10/10,1 February 2012,gigan-92,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Wartime Themes,"Love and sacrifice during WWII underlie the story about a café owner named Rick (Humphrey Bogart), and his link to two intellectual refugees from Nazi occupied France. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and, like other European refugees, gravitate to Rick's upscale café, near the city's airport, with its revolving searchlight.

Rick is a middle-aged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism, especially for people in need, like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.

Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's café, an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons, from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's café that renders this film so appealing, with a variety of interesting accents, clothes, and uniforms. And, of course, there's Sam, the piano player, who plays all the favorites, including ""As Time Goes By"".

All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script, with its colorful characters, like the debonair Captain Renault (Claude Rains); and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), the articulate and portly ""leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca"". And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's (Corinna Mura), whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.

The film's dialogue, though substantial, is clever and lively, like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar: ""How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that; some day they may be scarce"".

High-contrast B&W lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning; it evokes a feeling of far-off adventure.

""Casablanca"" differs from traditional noir films, mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism, an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.",No rating,28 November 2007,Lechuguilla,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
".....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, As Time Goes By.""","It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.

Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century.

Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.

Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.

The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment.

So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.

I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.

Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.

There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.

Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.

"The writing, the character actors, the lighting, and then, for dessert, some romance, too. Oh, and America goes to war at last.","Casablanca (1942)

When Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), ""If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"" he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.

Need and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.

The romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.

These great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the café as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect.

There isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights. It's not a great film by accident, and it doesn't hide why it's great. There are better films, I suppose, of course there are, depending who you ask and on what day. But not many.",10/10,17 October 2009,secondtake,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
I've loved this film for thirty years.,"Casablanca is a film about the personal tragedy of occupation and war. It speaks to the oppression of the one side - and the heroism and self-deprecation of the other. From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy. Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love. Leading actors to please any appetite. Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it. It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are ""real to you."" It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.

Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story. Through this film, Casablanca will always live in my heart and I will think of its characters as family.

Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.",10/10,29 November 2000,Questor,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.""","The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's  man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.

What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.

She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.

""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed.",10/10,6 December 2006,JFHunt,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Meh. It was alright.,"I'll open up with my unpopular opinion. I wasn't a fan of Casablanca. It's was over the top, it was pompous and most importantly I just didn't enjoy it. Most of this has to due with context. I had some trouble on the first go around grasping everything that was going on, but I'm not holding any of that against the film.

The credit I will give to Casablanca is the dialog is engaging and the cinematography is excellent. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. It's at this point I even have to ask myself, why didn't I like it? I don't know, I just didn't. It didn't speak to me in the way that lesser films have. It's quite possible that in repeat viewings I'll pick up a detail I missed the first time around and have a renewed appreciation for the film, but as it stands now I respect Casablanca for everything that it is, but I didn't enjoy it and in my eyes that's the most important part of a film, no matter how important it may be historically.

Greatest Film Ever for Me,"Why do I consider this to be the greatest film ever, to begin with I consider it to be the most enjoyable film I have ever watched and the most re-watchable. The key ingredients in my mind include; wonderful dialogue (so many quotable oft repeated lines), amazing performances, a superb story that while relatively straightforward is also highly enjoyable and finally the great black and white cinematography. Beyond these ingredients its also a film moves quickly and I can't think of a single scene I found either uninteresting or unnecessary.

For those that desire a synopsis, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate running a popular nightclub in Casablanca a city under Vichy control. The cool disinterested facade Rick maintains is shaken when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) his former lover whom he thought dead appears suddenly in his club with her husband a resistance leader who requires safe passage out of German controlled territory. In order for the escape to succeed Rick must not only hide them from the Germans but also the local French police commander (Claude Raines) who is a friend but also a collaborator.

My favorite performance here will always be that of Humphrey Bogart as Rick a man of nobility while evidencing ambivalence, but his performance is closely followed by the wonderful Claude Raines and the limited but iconic performances of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. While Ingrid Bergman apparently did not enjoy her experience and it may not be among her greatest roles I thought it was still a great performance, and also that the chemistry between Bogart and herself was utterly convincing. Further I found both Paul Henreid in the thankless role of the other man in the love triangle and Conrad Veidt as the local German commander to be quite effective along with a good supporting cast.

As I have seen more and more of Michael Curtiz films I have come to believe he is an underrated director, its true he was not an auteur but a studio director who made the films he was assigned and he was not apparently a pleasant person to work with he has did leave behind an incredible legacy of films.

More average than I thought it would be.,"The movie had a decently compelling story and good scenes, and the actress who played Ilsa had definite talent. I liked the ending too, however I found it annoying that Humphrey Bogart said his famous line more times than necessary in my opinion. He should've said it twice instead of like 3-4 times which I started to roll my eyes at. Aside from a couple of pacing issues too, it was not bad! Slightly overrated though.

BORING and ARTIFICIAL. The emperor has no clothes.,"This is the only movie review I have ever written on IMDb.

I watched Casablanca witch high hopes. I KNEW I was going to love this movie after hearing for years how it's ""the best"" and what an amazing, moving, love story it portrays. I was very excited and ready to be swept off my rear end by this classic everyone adores.

Casablanca is one of the movies I disliked the most. Actually I think it's my number one most disliked movie. It's not that I don't like old movies or I have a short attention span. I've seen Gone with the wind multiple times and love it. One of my favorite movies is a *1951 Indian, BLACK AND WHITE, ROMANCE* (!!!) movie, I've also seen that numerous times. Casablanca is as boring and plain as a movie can get. It's 102 minutes of nothing interesting happening AT ALL. Gone with the wind is a slow movie that needs patience to watch but lots of interesting things happen, there is a traceable story line and the characters are not plain and one-dimensional like in Casablanca. What happens in this movie? Is there anything interesting happening at all that anybody can point out to? I don't think so.

It's just 102 minutes of random boring people talking about random boring stuff. When I read good reviews of Casablanca I have never seen or heard anyone point out to anything interesting actually happening in this movie. Just how pretty Ingrid was, how cool Bogart was, how well done the movie is, how impeccable the acting is, silly meaningless quotes like ""here's looking at you kid"" and just that it's a ""timeless classic"". I just think this whole Casablanca thing is a gimmick and a case of ""the emperor's clothes"". There is nothing to be well acted or well done because there is nothing happening during the whole movie. I think it would be way more interesting to just film random conversations between random people in bars.

And the love story between the two main protagonists has to be the least believable I've ever seen. I enjoy and get emotionally moved very much by a love story, it doesn't even need to be very good. I cry when I read Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" for eff's sake. There is absolutely zero chemistry between the two main actors. Their ""love story"" is completely artificial, superficial and there is zero emotion portrayed. They seem to be acquaintances at best, not even friends, not to mention lovers. I've seen better simulated ""attraction"" or ""love"" in porn dialogues than in Casablanca. No, forget that, I can detect more love and attraction when two butterflies dance together or I see rabbits mating. I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.

This movie made me feel nothing at all, absolutely nothing except boredom. It's unique in this particularity. There is no other movie I can remember that made me feel NOTHING AT ALL. Bad movies at least amuse me. Casablanca is completely devoid of any emotion. Casablanca is the cinematic equivalent of a mouthful of sand. There was no character I could empathize with in the slightest way as there were no real, humane characters to empathize with. Just artificiality.

I'm completely mesmerized about how can people adore this movie so much. It's boring, plain, bone-dry, story-less and features the least believable love stories I have ever seen.

Excuse me, I'm not a connoisseur like you Casablanca lovers, but I have common sense. And common sense tells me a movie doesn't have to be necessarily very ""entertaining"" but it needs to be ENJOYABLE, reasonably ENGAGING and just in the least to have some INTERESTING things happening. Casablanca has none of this things in the slightest.

Please leave aside your love for this movie, imagine for one minute you don't know who Ingrid and Bogart were and this movie was completely unknown. You've never heard a thing about this movie your entire life and you just watch it not knowing anything about it or the actors. Would you enjoy it? I guarantee you would be bored out of your mind. That is why it is not a ""TIMELESS"" classic. Here's two movies I would consider timeless classics: Papillon and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Not this bore fest.

I would give Casablanca a negative rating if I could.

"Of all the classics in all the films in all the world, this is the best!","This is a film that MUST belong in every video collection in the U.S. is not in the world. The stories about it's making are legendary from the constant rewrites to the apocrypha of casting stories.

What is amazing to me, and the reason I believe it holds audiences almost spellbound in successive viewings, is the connection with the horrors of World War II was almost every single cast member. Sidney Greenstreet had lost a son in combat, and a number of the cast members fled Europe to escape the ravages of a Hitler regime. Even the evil Nazi character Major Strasser (played with relish by Conrad Veidt) had left Nazi Germany to escape almost sure internment and possible death in a concentration camp. Here was a man who was a legend in German film history as the murdering somnambulist (a possible warning about the Nazi soldiers to come?) and because of the vicious anti-Semitism and racism of the Germany of the '30s and '40s, we in America and in Hollywood were given a great gift.

Everyone in this film is fabulous, but it is the chemistry of Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) been truly holds the film together. When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s, I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine's character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart. There is a reason why he was named the actor of the century.

While every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.

I must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can't watch it with me anymore.

The line that sticks out the most for me, and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater. It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table, ""There are parts of New York I wouldn't advise you to invade."" And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script. That movie was ""All Through The Night."" I love this movie too, and I'm not even a New Yorker.

There have been many attempts to revisit ""Casablanca,"" but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through ""The Good War"" in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.

Even though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.

If you've never seen this movie before, shame on you and see it immediately. If you only seen it once, I believe you will come back to it more than once. This is just about the most perfect film ever made and it is a miracle that that is so considering that there were so many hands in the pie. (Excuse me for my mixing my metaphors. It's late, and I get emotional just thinking about this classic film masterpiece.)

Play it again and again and again and again, Sam.",No rating,11 August 2004,jwpeel-1,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
A perfect film.,"Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.

Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.

Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people.",10/10,30 December 2008,planktonrules,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"For all-around entertainment, the best I've ever seen","CASABLANCA is the best treatment ever of the ancient theme of the love triangle. Set in World War II Casablanca, a Moroccan city under the control of the collaborationist Vichy French government, the movie starts with a news wire that two German couriers have been murdered and their letters of transit stolen. Each letter will permit one person to leave Casablanca to a neutral country.

Enter Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner of the shady but cheerful Cafe Americaine. Rick is a cynical and hard-nosed man whose motto is, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" Like many a cynic, Rick is an embittered ex-idealist, still nursing his wounds from being abandoned by his lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). By chance he falls into possession of the missing letters of transit.

Enter Ilsa, who comes to Casablanca on the arm of Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a few steps ahead of the Nazi police. We now have three people and two letters of transit. Who will reach America, and who will stay in Casablanca?

I know no other movie that so perfectly balances humor, romance, and drama. The soul of good drama lies in presenting characters with hard choices, and few choices are as hard, or as illuminating of the protagonists' makeup, as the choices in CASABLANCA. All of the characters must decide what they will give up for love, for honor, and for themselves. The scenes of Rick and Ilsa's love, years ago in Paris, are some of the finest romantic scenes in cinema. And the humor, particularly in the person of Casablanca's Prefect of Police, Louis Renault, has contributed dozens of dry witticisms to our everyday language - ""I am shocked! Shocked! - ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" - ""I was misinformed."" - ""It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles."" So perfectly blended are these three major elements that you cannot point to a single shot or scene that should have been eliminated from the movie. Never try to watch only one scene from CASABLANCA; you will inevitably be absorbed until the very end of the film. It is little short of miraculous that the chaotically mismanaged shooting of this movie resulted in such a magnificent final product; it speaks volumes for luck and for Owen Marks' and Michael Curtiz' post-production editing.

I have never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized. Every minor character is a fleshed-out, realistic individual, from Sasha to Carl the headwaiter to Rick's competitor Ferrari to the self-effacing criminal Ugarte. Claude Rains' Captain Renault (""I'm only a poor corrupt official"") steals scene after scene, and Dooley Wilson's Sam is a refreshingly loyal, charismatic and sympathetic conception from an era when almost all black characters were rendered as demeaning stereotypes. The only character who tastes of the cliche is the villainous Major Strasser, which can be forgiven in a wartime production.

The only film I have ever seen as tautly effective as CASABLANCA is GLORY. Although the 54th Mass.'s story is arguably superior even to CASABLANCA for sheer dramatic power and acting talent, GLORY lacks CASABLANCA's wonderful humor and romance, which causes me to give the edge to Curtiz' classic as the better-rounded movie. I have yet to see CASABLANCA surpassed.

A Perfect Film But Let's Clear Up A Few Rumors,"In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. ""Rick's Café Américain"" attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.

Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of ""letters of transit"" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.

Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about ""Casablanca"" but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying ""The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting"". That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for ""things to change"" while a film was in production. ""Casablanca was no exception!

Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only ""thought of"" but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast!

Rumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days.

Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.

Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless ""Batman"" plays Ric!",10/10,25 March 2018,Sober-Friend,Casablanca (1942),NEGATIVE
Rightfully one of cinema's finest stories ever told.,"""Casablanca"" is a timely and timeless classic about a politically neutral saloon owner Rick in unoccupied France at a crossroads of destiny, conviction, and courage in his life. ""Casablanca"" is on the top of every film class's watchlist to study for just about every aspect of filmmaking imaginable.

While the film's plot is air-shut tight and the characterization feels authentic over 70 years later, the main focus of ""Casablanca"" is idea focused. During a time of political neutrality, America was entering the war as was Rick, our hard-on-the-edges protagonist. This can be considered an ""enlist"" film to anyone on the fence. Because of it's conviction-driven focus on ideas and philosophy, and how grounded those struggles feel, ""Casablanca"" remains one of the most well regarded classics of all time. The struggles of Rick are applicable to anyone who watches the film, drawing on universal themes like conviction, courage, compassion, and love.

The character of Rick is a fascinating one on an individual basis. We're set up to a character who's meticulous and thoughtful in the way he does things, paralleled by the chess game he has with no one. At the same time, we know of his loneliness without a partner to play with. We understand the respect he commands with patrons of the saloon yet the deep friendship he experiences with Sam. And while his corrupt inner shell shared with the chief is off-putting like a villain, we know he's ""...at heart, a sentimentalist"" when we learn of his passionate love for Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa.

""Casablanca"" also features some of cinema's most iconic and beautifully crafted cinematography by the great Arthur Edeson and of course the director, Michael Curtiz's masterful control of capturing the romantic moment. Not only on a story-telling, narrative perspective, ""Casablanca"" is worth studying for it's remarkable technical quality.

While the film may be as close to perfect as one can get, some of the third act moments can feel unnatural and forced which could disorient some modern viewers. Nitpicking aside, ""Casablanca"" remains one of cinema's finest pieces of celluloid to date. Anyone looking for another round of film study or a clean dive into old classic films, this would be perfect to start with. It's rich in themes, characters, and intelligence.",10/10,27 September 2017,tyson-hunsaker,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"""Who's got trouble? We got trouble.""","For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.

Everybody knows about Casablanca – even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme ""As Time Goes By"", but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the ""Knock on Wood"" number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is ""a special friend of Rick's"". This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.

Then there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this – crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.

But of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type – perhaps his archetypal role – and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.

On that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads – not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca – whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to. It makes us feel that the struggles of every minor player – Peter Lorre's nervous underground agent, Joy Page's young wife desperate to escape the city, S.Z. Sakall's jovial headwaiter, the sadly-unsung Dooley Wilson – are as important and immediate as those of the lead players. It is perhaps more than anything else this rich humanity that made the picture connect with wartime audiences, and has made it a work of power and resonance ever since.",10/10,27 October 2010,Steffi_P,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Casablanca,"Lovers from the past find each other once again in Casablanca during the early years of World War II. Rick, a tough and seemingly cold American ex pat is reunited with the love of his life Ilsa when she walks into his Cafe, years after she left him waiting for her at the train station in Paris. When Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit the two plan to leave Casablanca together but he instead chooses to make sure Ilsa is safe away from Casablanca and gives her away to her husband.

I'm sad to say that Casablanca was not exactly what I expected. Even with a little background information on what was taking place during the film, it was still rather difficult to follow with what seemed like lots of characters thrown into the mix. The flow of the film seemed a bit inconsistent; slow for long periods with small bursts of important information. Being referred to as one of the most romantic screen plays of all time, I was a bit let down to see little romance and was little there was, lacked in true on screen chemistry.

Although my first impression of the film was not the best, I believe it is one that deserves to be a watched a few more times in order to understand and follow it better.

One of the best black and white films I have ever had the privilege of watching!,"Casablanca is just an extraordinary film, if I had to describe it in one word, it would have to be perfection! I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10/10,21 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
"Great characters, classic dialogue, teary-eyed romance...","Humphrey Bogart in his preeminent role, that of the marvelously tough nightclub owner Rick Blaine, living in Algiers and sheltering refugee ex-girlfriend Ingrid Bergman and her new husband from the invading Nazis. Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good? Beautiful cinematography by Arthur Edeson; Max Steiner's score is used to underline everything, but Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By"" makes up for the oversell. *** from ****

I don't get it,"I tried so hard to like this movie. I understand - it's a classic, and anyone who loves movies should swear by this film because it's this and that and the other and it can cure warts and remove cellulite and fix your car... An hour into it, my date and I were so lost that we turned it off. The acting was great, of a caliber we don't see much of in modern movies, but the storyline just didn't sit with me. I had no idea what was going on half the time (the legal aspects, for instance) because I don't have an intimate knowledge of the time period or location, and when I did understand what was happening (the affair), I wasn't sure why this movie had become classic. I mean no offense to the people who love this movie. I just wish I could have loved it, too.

A Classic Worth Remembering,"While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention. By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly. Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.

The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast. Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments. It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films. It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly. (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)

But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else. Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything. While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching.",No rating,6 December 2001,Snow Leopard,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Cinema par Excellence!,"Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" opens on maps while a narrator gives a detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Casablanca in the French Morocco, as a refugee route from wartime Europe...

The Nazi envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser puts it: 'Human life is cheap in Casablanca."" Of course because a man may be executed in its crowded market before Marshal Pétain's portrait or where a charming girl may guarantee an exit visa by spending her night with the Prefect of Police...

Rick's Café is the point of intersection, the espionage center, the background for Allied offensive, the focal point as refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe seek to gain exit visas to Lisboa... The interesting club so well organized, leads to an open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, in which the games and fights are between arrogant Nazis, patriotic French, idealists, murderers, pickpockets and gamblers around a roulette wheel, where a ball could rest on Rick's command against the settled number 22...

""Casablanca"" is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns... The action, the fight, the war takes place inside Rick's walls rather than outside...

But who is this Rick? What is his magical power? His secret weapon? Rick is the anti-fascist with hard feelings, the former soldier of fortune who has grown tired of smuggling and fighting, and is now content to sit out the war in his own neutral territory... Even loyalty to a friend doesn't move him as he refuses to help Ugarte, a desperately frightened little courier who is fleeing from the police...

Emphatically, Rick says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers... She is married to an underground leader and she desperately needs those papers Rick conveniently now has in his possession... The cynical Rick's facade of neutrality begins to weaken as he recalls the bittersweet memories of his past love affair, memories triggered repeatedly when the strains of ""As Time Goes By"" come from Sam, his piano-playing confidante...

But ""Casablanca"" basic message is a declaration of self-sacrifice... War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' It goes without saying that Bogart is incomparable when he seems most like himself... His way with a line makes ""Casablanca"" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray. You were blue.'

Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles With his customary skill, Claude Rains plays Major Renault, a prefect of police who is like Bogart in many ways... He, too, claims neutrality, but is definitely against the Nazis... He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a ""sentimentalist"" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines... When he makes a small bet and is encouraged to make a bigger one, he remarks that he is only a ""poor corrupt official.""

Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love-affair, the quality of being romantic, the traditional woman enclosed by two rivals, symbol of a besieged Europe...

Paul Henreid is Victor Laszlo, the anti-Nazi resistance leader, seeking in Morocco the two letters of transit signed by General De Gaulle...

Sidney Greenstreet is the black marketeer on good terms with Rick, the rival owner of the 'Blue Parrot,' the acceptable face of corruption...

Peter Lorre is Ugarte, the racketeer, the dealer of anything illegal, the killer, driven into a corner by the Vichy police, who has given Rick two letter of transit...

Conrad Veidt is the very essence of German rigidity, unfeeling, unconcerned about life, but firmly believing in the foolish ideology of his Nazi compatriots...

""Casablanca"" covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence; the blissful days in Paris; Ilsa's emotional words to Rick in occupied Paris; the champagne toast; Ilsa's request to Sam; the poetry of the magic words and the beautiful voice of Dooley Wilson; Captain Renault's words in the airport; and the farewell...

The magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy... To his cynicism, his own code of ethics, his hatred of the phoniness in all human behavior, he now added the softening traits of tenderness and compassion and a feeling of heroic commitment to a cause... They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival...

One can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place... Its photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly... Bogart's and Bergman's love scenes create a genuinely romantic aura, capturing a sensitivity between the two stars one would not have believed possible...

""Casablanca"" is a masterpiece of entertainment, an outstanding motion picture which brought Bogart his first Academy Award nomination (he lost to Paul Lukas for ""Watch On the Rhine"") and won Awards for Best Picture of the Year, Best Director and Best Screenplay...

Hollywood at its most significant,"Casablanca is a Hollywood movie made in the peak of Hollywood filmmaking. A powerful romance so well-acted by a superb cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The writing is excellent with a pitch-perfect running time and many lines that have become classic. All of these elements are expertly brought together by director Curtiz in his best film. It stands alongside Citizen Kane and Gone with the wind for the best movie ever made. It certainly features Hollywood at the peak of its form an engaging acting at the top of its form. Not one moment I regretted watching for a second but the end is the best part.

Not before nor after will such a brilliant piece of cinematic brilliance exist. Yet... I see scattered low reviews, even 1's that are absolutely appalling. Which brings me to my point.. people can have their opinions, but when they go against everything that makes good common sense I have to conclude they must live a very miserable life. There is simply no justification to give Casablanca a poor rating.. none. It will continue to endure those few callous smears throughout history as it is as timeless as infinity. To quote Rick..

The Band Wagon Effect,"I'm a fan of almost everyone who appears in Casablanca, at least in every other movie they were ever in. Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and so on. But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's ""greatness"", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give ""African Queen"" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the ""perfect film"", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one. Entertaining for its time period, but not great. But cheer up, Casablanca fans, we'll always have Gaslight, Notorious, Maltese Falcon, and Treasure of the Sierra Madre'.",6/10,18 January 2006,TheodenLives,Casablanca (1942),NEGATIVE
I laughed! I cried!,"Most teenagers don't watch classics I know. But after they've seen this one, there's no turning back! This is the classic to end all classics (That and Gone With The Wind which rocked! but the ending was a bit unusual.) I had been an Ingrid Bergman fan after watching Gaslight with my drama class. It was great because I love a good mystery type thing.

Casablanca was a bit confusing at first, but I found out in the end that it has just the right blend of romance, drama, and comedy. Plus, my dad instilled in me a love for all things World War II related.

I would recommend this movie for children 15 and older, not because there's anything bad, but simply because I don't think younger children would understand it. You guys my age, this is a great Sit-down-and-watch-with-your-girl-on-a-rainy-afternoon type movie, and parents already love it, so everyone's happy.

Ageless classics,"The film ""Casablanca"", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II.

Acting in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity.

The picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not.

Despite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, ""Casablanca"" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that ""Casablanca"" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic.

Dull & way overrated,"I'm not going to slate the film any more than that, as millions still love it now, so it must be me that's in the wrong, but it was such a hard film to watch.

The acting was faultless. But that's it really. The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.

The 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today.

But the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable.

Good cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.

There was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly ""here's looking at you kid"" don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.

A 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.

Though this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it.

But then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.

"As time goes by, it's still one of the all-time greats...","While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film:

""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.

Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment. It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.

Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.""

And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!! As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar!

Start of a beautiful friendship,"Humphrey Bogart (Rick) and Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) each own a café/bar in Casablanca which is frequented by those wishing to make an exit to Lisbon and a new found freedom. Casablanca is on French soil and Claude Rains (Renault) is the Captain in charge who must co-operate with Nazi Conrad Veidt (Strasser). The two cafes are riddled with black market shenanigans and into this town wanders Resistance leader Paul Henreid (Victor Lazlo) and Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa). In order to make it to freedom, an exit visa is required and this is what Henreid and Bergman are after.

An entertaining film with a good cast and very amusing dialogue. Bogart rattles off some classic lines but it's Claude Rains whose delivery tops the charts. One moment that I found funny is when a grateful couple approach him and enthusiastically let him know that they will be at his office at 6:00am to collect their visas. ""I'll be there at 10:00"" is his reply. The moral of that is don't be so keen, it gets you nowhere. A good lesson for anyone starting a new job.

""Here's looking at you"" gets a bit clichéd but it doesn't matter. I never cared for Humphrey Bogart and his man who stands alone image. It always struck me as cold and unpleasant. However, I'm starting to really like him these days.

One daft thing about the film is how the Nazis didn't find the visas. The hiding place is pretty obvious if you ask me. A couple of last points - remember next time you get to a roulette table – number 22 - and the French National Anthem is way better than the dreary UK effort.",8/10,14 September 2015,AAdaSC,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE

"""As Time Goes By...""","As the film's theme song so aptly observes, things change as time goes by. People, politics, relationships- none of these are safe from the passage of time. This is never truer than in the fictional story that takes place in one Moroccan city of a 1942 masterpiece. In Casablanca, this concept is exemplified expertly in a timeless classic directed by Michael Curtiz.

The story centers on the reunion of two ex-lovers and how their past relationship fits into their present circumstances. In the city of Casablanca, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is living his life lightly and superficially, making no personal connections to anyone, as is fittingly demonstrated by a character-defining line in the beginning of the movie 'I stick my neck out for nobody'. He's seemingly satisfied with this unfulfilling existence when a ghost from his past (Ingrid Bergman) walks back into his life (and into his bar) with her new prestigious husband, Victor Laszlo. Rick is surprised and unhinged at her sudden presence, and Ilsa obviously is as well. The couple is there to escape the World War II Nazi Germany, but cannot leave without Rick's help. Old feelings must be faced, and life altering choices made before anyone can enjoy a happily ever after.

The title this movie has earned as one of the greatest of all time is not earned easily, nor given lightly. Greatness is found in the dialogue, acting, camera shots, etc. My personal favorite aspect is the dialogue. The film is surprisingly funny, in all the back-and-forth lines delivered with a perfect dose of dry humor, such as Rick's response to his file ('Are my eyes really brown?"") and Renault's feigned outrage (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). The peppering of these well-delivered lines throughout the film really makes the movie for me. The writing is terrific, and almost every line is memorable. I also admire the depth of each character. Rick at first appears to be a cool, selfish bar owner, but we see that he is actually just a broken-hearted man, and 'a rank sentimentalist'. Ilsa as a character is layered and mysterious. She is conflicted- neither the audience, nor the woman herself, can tell which man she loves most. We never know through what she tells us, rather the answer is gleaned from significant looks and body language.

That especially is an excellent facet of Casablanca- the subtlety. Much of the plot is derived from facial expressions and what is found behind a character's words or actions rather than their face value appearance. For example, Ugarte hints to Rick that he killed the German couriers in order to obtain the transit letter. In response to Ugarte's earlier question, Rick says ""You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you"" -his tone of disgust in this line is slight, but significant. Or at the conclusion of the film, Ilsa is to board a plane with one of the men. It turns out to be Victor. She never says which man she wants it to be, but as she walks away she turns her head to look at Rick one last time and we can clearly see the answer. These moments and many like them exhibit the unassuming skill of the film.

I have only just touched on a few of the many great merits of Casablanca. It is a fantastic film, and I understand why it has earned so many raving reviews over the years. It's now one of my favorites and I know it's one I will watch again and again. The movie appeals to a broad audience- from film experts to average movie watchers, it is accessible and enjoyable. This appeal extends across generations, as it has survived all these years and will for many more to come. Maybe some things don't change.

As time goes by, indeed.

Claude reigns,"Ah, Casablanca...everyone's second favorite movie! On the recent DVD commentary, Ebert remarks that he's never heard a bad review of this film. I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white. So, we can disregard their opinions then! Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.

I consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting. The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).

My favorite thing about Casablanca? Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie! Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever. Greenstreet and Lorre (or, as I prefer to call them, the Fat Man and the Bug) have more personality than most of today's ""stars"" combined, and they're just two of the many highlights here.",10/10,19 March 2004,dr_foreman,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
If you had to pick one scene from 'Casablanca'...,"I'd have to say my favorite scene is the one in which Paul Henreid leads the singing in Rick's. As one writer put it, ""One by one, the habitués of the bar join in the ""Marseillaise."" The Germans sing still louder, but they're no match for the pro-French civilians. Drowned out, the soldiers give up in disgust. The ""Marseillaise"" comes to its stirring conclusion, and with tears in their eyes the patriots in the bar cry out, ""Vive la France!""

This scene always brings tears to my eyes which illustrates, among other things, the power of music in movies.

"""... human life is cheap.""","Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom.",10/10,1 June 2009,cordaro9418,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
A good movie,"If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.

In the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy.",6/10,2 October 2012,ctimmons-492-149018,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE

CASABLANCA (1942) - 16/10/2019,"""Casablanca"" is a tight movie. Craftsmanship is the name of the game, and with every line, look, and movement contributing to its story, not a moment of what you see on screen is wasted. Fully realized locations, legendary performers at the top of their game, and a story that sneaks up on you with how powerful it suddenly becomes -- yes, ""Casablanca"" deserves the place it has made itself at the top of all-time lists. Even today it's more entertaining and emotionally resonant than many current films. That it is from 1942 and yet remains so relevant today is simply mind-blowing.

Great Acting!,"After hearing all of the hype surrounding this film my expectations were set rather high, but after i finally sat down and watched this film i was kind of let down. While this film was a bit of a let down it was still somewhat interesting to watch. This film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away. The plot was somewhat interesting but moved a little to slow in my opinion. Overall this film is way over hyped and in my opinion should not be considered on of the best films ever made.

I watched it once in my 20s and just thought it was ok. I watched it again in my 50s and now I think it might be the best movie ever made. I cried so hard was shaking uncontrollably. It probably won't have that effect on you unless you really believe in their feelings and the sacrifices they are having to make.

Greatest war propaganda movie ever made,"Every thing positive everyone has ever said about this movie is true. Still compelling after all these years, one of my top ten movies, I can go back and watch every few years.

This movie works on every level, drama, love story, suspense, but most of all it is a war propaganda movie. Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even a little anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when the outcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the war effort. It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives and gas rationing' and other techniques to get public support. It is impossible for a film made for this purpose to stand the test of time, but Casablanca has, and that's why it is such an incredible film.

"Of all the review joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walks into mine. Here's to you, Kid. Casablanca is iconic! Play it again, Sam.","From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song ""As Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Café. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme ""As Time Goes By"" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

Quite simply the greatest film in American history,"Casablanca is the consummate Hollywood film. It is superbly directed, acted, and filmed. Bogart is amazing, the characters are deep and engaging.

This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. The story is timeless and meaningful, full of heart and should endure for another fifty years with no problems. A true masterpiece and the benchmark by which all other films should be measured. If you haven't seen it, you are at a profound loss. If you have then you know the greatness of this film.

One of the great films,"I have seen the film many times. It is an amazingly durable piece. It endures because of the underlying meaning -- a man is faced with the choice of being a responsible person or simply following his emotional whims. Every character has some interesting quality or quirk. I have used the film in my classes to make the point of how a good story can have a deeper meaning without coming across as a sermon.

"An American in wartime Morocco: pretty good, but too many contrivances","I've seen this film, in part or whole, a number of times over the years. Used to be I thought it was pretty boring, until the climax at the end. Now that I analyzed it in some depth,I appreciate the whole film more, despite various major contrivances. I'm still not convinced that Humphrey Bogart was the right actor to play the main character: American, Rick. He was good in the climactic sequence, but often rather boring before that. I'm not sure how much was due to the script and how much was due to Bogie's basic personality. I suspect some of both.

The plot is divided into 2 parts, both of which are relevant throughout most of the film to the end. There's the question of how Czech resistance fighter Victor Laszio(Paul Henreid) was going to get out of French Morocco, needing a letter of transit to do so. He was considered very dangerous by the Germans. Hence, they sent a patrol, headed by Major Strasser, to Casablanca, where they guessed he would end up, to make sure he didn't leave for a safe haven(the USA). Secondly, the present and future status of the past love affair between Rick and Scandinavian Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman), wife of Laszio, needs to be worked out. Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris, after it was reported that Laszio had been killed by the Germans. When the Germans were about to take over Paris, it was decided they needed to leave France. But, mysteriously, Ilsa didn't show up at the train station where she was supposed to meet Rick. He went south by himself, on to Morocco. Now, she showed up in his café with Laszio. Rick didn't find out until later that they were married before she met Rick, and she only learned that he was alive the day she was supposed to go with Rick. She explained to Rick that she didn't tell him she had been married because it was a secret to help protect her from harm by the Germans. This eased his mind somewhat. This type of love triangle is always difficult to work out, especially if the woman has married her new love: not a factor here. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing which man Ilsa will end up with, whether she makes the choice or it's made for her(it is). I think Ingrid was an excellent choice for Ilsa, having grown up in Scandinavia, her English speech was so European, and she was a lovely and good actress. The occasional close-ups of the faces, especially Ingrid's, helps to define their emotional state.

The all important travel document which we are bothered with from the beginning to the very end was an invention of the script writer, having no historical relevance. In the first and last parts of the film, this document is called a letter of transit, whereas in the middle portion, it's called an exit visa. I'm assuming these are the same thing, but it unnecessarily confuses the audience(at least me).

We have a fairly interesting group of secondary characters: not too many, and of various nationalities and allegiances relating to the war. Renault(Claude Rains), the French chief of police, says he doesn't have strong feelings about the Vichy vs. free French choice. He will bend with the prevailing wind. Rick similarly claims neutrality. But, like the US, still officially neutral, there are several indications that he's not as neutral as he claims.

Clearly, Rick is very depressed about something through most of the film. His café seems to be thriving, so what is it? Partly, the uncertainty of the war, I believe. Also, the void in his romantic life after Ilsa disappeared. He hasn't found an adequate replacement, taking up with a floozy in the meanwhile, and uncertain about what Ilsa wants for the future. When Ilsa pulls a gun on him to hand over the letters of transit he inherited, he remarks ""Go ahead and shoot, you'll be during me a favor"". He's also cynical about the war, and the world in general. When Laszio answers ""If we stop fighting, the world will die"", Rick responds. ""What of it. That will put it out of its misery"". With his depression and cynicism dominating his personality, he's a hard man for audiences to like. That's a big problem with this film. But as Renault observes, despite his cynicism and depression, occasionally, he's a sentimentalist. This is shown when he orders the roulette wheel to be 'fixed' so that it comes up the number for a young Bulgarian refugee so that he will have the money to buy a letter of transit, so he and his wife can go to the US. Similarly, in finally providing letters of transit for Laszio and Ilsa, and giving up claim on Ilsa, he demonstrates compassion.

""Casablanca"" is not only a love story and wartime drama, it can be considered a musical! Of course, the most remembered song is ""As Time Goes By"". I was surprised to learn this song had been kicking around for a decade before. Of course, its inclusion in this film much increased its visibility. Another prominent song is ""Knock on Wood"": the only song specifically composed for this film. Then, there's the famous competition between the Germans, singing a German song, and the much more numerous other patrons of Rick's cafe, drowning them out with ""La Marseillaise"". Many others were played at least a little, mostly by Dooley Wilson, as listed under 'Soundtracks' at this site.

Casablanca,"This movie was excellent, I really liked the comedy in all of the seriousness. I thought despite all of the politics and revolt, that this was a beautiful story of love, and struggle. The relationships between all of the characters was amazing, the way they all just seemed to belong together in this time and place, in these situations. though all of the characters work to pull the wool over each others eyes and keep out of view of the Germans, in the end one large scheme pulls everyone together and allows everyone to end up where they belong. Through Ricks many connections in Casablanca he is able to run a money making business that also acts as a safe house for exchange of things not so legal at this time, and brings him a part of his past he would of much rather lived without ever remembering again...Ilsa. In the end nothing is really what it seems...

From Selfish to Selfless.,"Casablanca is an incredible film, the lighting, script, acting everything together just made this movie a classic like no other. What stood out the most to me was the use of music in this film. Sams voice of course was a highlight for me, his performances set this film above others in this time. Especially the use of the song ""as time goes by"" the song is so prominent in the film and there are so many different emotions that accompany it throughout the film. The song showed the evolution of Sam and Ilsa's relationship, there were the moments were the song was filled with anger and what was lost and the moments of them in love and finding each other again. With the movie being so fast pace there are a lot of moments that can be missed or misunderstood but the feelings the actors portrayed when ""as time goes by"" played made the feelings in those moments easy to comprehend. Also Rick of course was a stand out character and evolved greatly throughout the film. Rick was one person to Ilsa and one person to everyone else who knew him at the Cafe. After Rick lost Ilsa he became selfish and full of anger, but as the film went on he stripped away his hard exterior and ultimately gave up everything he ever wanted so Ilsa could have the life he knew she deserved. Ricks selflessness at the end of the film showed just how strong his love for Ilsa was, he chose her happiness over his.

"Wake up, folks! This movie stinks!","I read all the other ""user's comments"", and found out there are only 3 among those 54 who didn't like this movie!! Well, I will add to that short list. Ever since I was a kid, I heard of Casablanca as ""one of the best movies ever made"". Sorry, folks. I watched it three times, and the more I watch the less I like it.

The characters are as empty as sea-shells. Bogart (whom I never found a bit attractive anyway) mumbles through the story, as a one-dimensional ""cynical with a big heart"" (my god, what a novelty!!), Bergman cries a lot, but as a compliant female does what she's told and follows her husband: Rick is a man, he knows what's best for her, and her husband needs her support, he's a war hero!! I would rather be alone, anyway, if I had to choose between dull Laszlo and cowardly Rick!

Fortunately Claude Rains can be funny, though utterly unlikely as an officer who at the last moment chooses to ""be good"". Nothing is convincing!

I have nothing against ""classics"", as Parca (another user) said before: I love Lawrence of Arabia, The Night of the Hunter (now THAT is a movie!!), Gone With the Wind... But Casablanca cannot be worshipped as one of the ""best ever"". It's the forties' version of a pop-corn movie. Should you see it if you haven't yet? Yeah, why not? Otherwise, how can you judge?

Just don't think you HAVE TO love it.",3/10,1 June 1999,Eponine-6,Casablanca (1942),NEGATIVE
classic,"I don't know why I waited so long to see this film,,, I picked this one up at a local Goodwill for 25 cents.. best quarter I ever spent.. Humphrey Bogart gives one of the best performances as night club owner Rick,, Ingrid Bergman is astonishing in her beauty as well as her acting skills.. Claude Rains is also wonderful.. and Peter Lorre is in it two, so what's not to love,, the story takes place WWII , and people are trying to get letters of transit , so they can get out of Casablanca, and to other places, such as America,, a man comes into Rick's club one day , and needs to stash these letters of transit because he is suspected by the local police,, so he leaves them with Rick,, he stashes them for future use,, then his ex- love walks into his club,, my fav Bogey quote "" of all the gin joints in all the world,, why did she have to come into mine'. this movie is not overrated whatsoever,, I gave it a perfect 10 because I believe that it is not flawed in any way,, I enjoyed the acting,, the storyline,, and everything this is Humphrey Bogart..

Casablanca,"What can be said that has not already been said about this film for the ages? Allstar cast made up of the usual subjects...Bogie, Sydney, Peter (also together in ""Maltese Falcon""). Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa never looked better...she is absolutely perfect for the time and place. Sam, the Coupier, the bartender, the waiter, and of course Louie, generate the same electricity, heart, soul, in this one magical blend as we have seen in long running sitcoms like 'Taxi', 'Mash', and especially 'Cheers'. You will want to see it over and over again. A movie the entire family can watch, no censorship needed. It grabs you from the opening narration and doesn't let go...The ending is a classic. 'Casablanca' and you; The start of a beautiful friendship.

Ten Stars Says it all,"This film started life as just another Warner pot boiler. No one involved thought of it as even potentially great. The script writing often progressed from day-to-day and the actors were bit players or not well known character actors. Many of the actors were recently arrived war refugees. Bogart was known for his gangster films where most of the time he dies ignominiously. Ingrid Bergman was largely unknown outside of Sweden and her beauty alone makes the picture worth a view. Today, most critics rank this film as the greatest ever made and I've no doubt they're correct. Much of its dialog has become iconic and has beome part of popular culture. The ending is breathtaking in it's simplicity and it is honestly without equal with one possible exception. I've seen this movie so many times that I've memorized the dialog and it always effects me in a way no other film does. Younger audiences complain about the black and white filmography, often overly dramatic 1940s acting style, and lack sex, violence, car crashes, and explosions. This film, thankfully, is guilty of all these points. Look past the typical triteness of modern cinema and see a film that's almost in a class by itself and has come to define a great movie.",10/10,24 July 2021,rogerhwerner,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Rewatchable and Legendary,"Everything about this movie is great. The cast. The acting. The script/screenplay. The photography. This movie's influence is apparent. It's one of the most quoted ""classic"" Hollywood movies of all time. This is also rewatchable for years to come. You can notice a different detail seemingly with every viewing. There's a lot to take in, historically and story wise. There's a lot to like. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself good and solve that problem.

Brave ending makes this a classic,"The Classics Tour: Part 1 ""Casablanca""

I thought I was a movie geek but then realised I had not seen hardly anything pre 1960 - I'm about to change that. First stop Casablanca.

What first struck me about Casablanca was the script, sharp and witty at times and include more classic lines that you could erm... well lots of classic lines.

Yes many lines from this film have been said time and time again and are part of our culture now. The final lines Bogie utters to the lovely Ingrid Bergman before she leaves I had heard before and I hadn't seen the film!

Next Humphrey Bogart. He's a really cool guy and his performance in this movie is pitch perfect I aim to watch some more of this mans movies.

Casablanca surprised me I must admit. The ending is brave indeed and contributes to its legendary status of that I have no doubt. Any ending where the lead doesn't get the girl, where the love rival is as brave if not braver just adds layers to an already great story with such a crackling script.

Its hard to recommend this film as many sadly would not get over its age. To be fair it has taken me a while to get round to appreciating old films but there is a whole gold mine out there and I can't wait to get stuck in.

I am delighted to admit for me personally Casablanca lived up to its reputation.

One of the Best Films of All Time,"Casablanca oozes pure class and style. Its a film that is easy to like. The acting is superb with Bogart playing a very cool, but wounded Rick. Also, Claude Rains as Capt. Renault was often very funny and gave the the film a lighthearted feel in between the more serious moments.

The director, Michael Curtiz did an excellent job creating a very subtle, oppressed feel to the characters on screen with the constant spotlight which can be felt in many of the scenes. Also, there was great use in lighting to foreshadow the intentions of many of the characters.

All around Casablanca has a great story, funny/touching moments and a definitive style. I would highly recommend this movie.

A Timeless Romance in a Turbulent Time,"Casablanca, a film wrapped in the warm embrace of nostalgia, deserves its classic status. I would give it a solid 7 out of 10, not for its intricate plot but for being the Humphrey Bogart of movies - charming, a bit mysterious, and undeniably entertaining.

Let's talk about the narrative twists. The plot might not stand up to rigorous scrutiny, but then again, Casablanca is more about capturing the essence of a turbulent era than meticulous storytelling. The ""letters of transit"" might sound like a convenient plot device, but they serve their purpose in keeping the tension alive.

Choosing Casablanca as a backdrop for a love story amidst political chaos might seem curious, but it adds a layer of complexity to the characters. Renault's questionable ethics reflect the moral ambiguity of the time, even if it doesn't align with modern standards.

The supporting cast is a vibrant mix of characters, from the rival nightclub owner Ferrari to the duplicitous police chief Renault, played with finesse by Claude Rains. Dooley Wilson's rendition of 'As Time Goes By' adds emotional depth to the film.

Bogart and Bergman share undeniable chemistry, even if their characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might hope. Paul Henreid as Laszlo embodies the spirit of resistance, though his post-US plans remain a mystery.

Casablanca, with its rose-tinted glasses and melodramatic crescendos, is a love letter to a bygone era. While it may not be a cerebral masterpiece, it captures the essence of wartime romance and sacrifice.

Woody Allen celebrated Bogart's performance in 'Play It Again, Sam,' paying homage to Casablanca. This connection adds another layer of appreciation for a film that continues to enchant audiences with its timeless allure.

10 lines of text,"I don't know that I can do the 10 lines of text for this. I mean, what can I say that won't be a repetition? This is the yardstick by which all movies are measured. It also contains one of the biggest misnomers of all time. NOBODY says ""Play it again, Sam"" during this movie. How many bar bets have I won with that one? (Lots) It also goes to show (to paraphrase another classic) 'you never know what you're gonna get'. This was a ""B"" movie completed in a very short time. And we wind up with a timeless classic. Personal note: IMHO, and not to detract from a wonderful ensemble cast, Claude Rains steals the show. A sign of a truly great film is one you pick up in the middle, no matter how often you have seen it, and you just can't turn it off.

cool,"Very long drove forward watch this the film. Simply regarded impossible for themselves not to familiarize themselves with such reinforced concrete classics. I was constantly faced with the mention somewhere of this film or quotes from it. In General, it happened. The beginning was delayed immediately and seemed promising, but somehow unexpectedly quickly came the final scene and the film ended. From the point of view of emotional coloring, the movie is very pleasant, there are moments for reflection in the aftertaste. In terms of expectations-Casablanca did not meet my expectations. The biggest disappointment is the lack of epicness, which was suspected thanks to the presence of three Oscars, universal gasps and comparisons with such a masterpiece of cinema as "" gone with the wind.""

the film is interesting, with a ""tasty"" game of actors. Dialogues me jobs indeed admired, sake of them can be even indulge, having revised picture still times, but in a whole the film leaves impression virtuoso theatrical setting.

"Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.","I do not like Casablanca. Wait! Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out. One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains. It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie. But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level. Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine. He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience. ""I stick my neck out for no one"", ""Rick never drinks with anyone"", etc., etc. These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out. Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back. I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions. It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine. The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song ""As Time Goes By"". But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time. Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison. Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened. It could have been a great and profound film. Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.

Timeless Classic (Bogart is a cinematic icon),"A true masterpiece that will never get old. Without doubt, one of the best romance movies of all time, parallelled perhaps only by the likes of 'Gone with the wind' or 'An affair to remember'. This movie will take you on a ride through every emotion imaginable and allow you to relate to and empathise with the characters with ease. This movie was not made with the expectancy of being an amazing watch, however this Warner Bros' A-List became one of the all-time greats and will wow you with its famous lines and beautiful scenes. For those of you who refrain from watching older, monochrome movies and prefer to watch newer Romance films such as 'Twilight' or 'The Notebook', please give this movie a chance and you will not regret it. Prepare to witness a real classic.

A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing 'A Classic'!...,"This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.

At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).

You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.

I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

My score: 9.7/10.

IMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).

Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 94/100 (based on 319,465 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",10/10,3 January 2012,ajs-10,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
An amazing tale of romance and sacrifice,"I've heard about this for a long time and didn't give it a chance since it was in black and white and not in color but I finally came around and watched it and I should've watched this earlier. This is a great film and anyone who's ever been in love before will probably enjoy this movie as it's a tale of sacrificing one's love for a greater cause.

It's simply ---- GREAT,"This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of ""cool"" and ""authoritative,"" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a ""no"" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside.

The arrogant big-shot shouts, ""What!? Do you know who I am!?"" Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, ""I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!""

Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the ""Letters of Transit"" which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story.

But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, ""You despise me, don't you?"" To which Bogie replies, ""Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.""

It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.

Regarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.

If someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, ""continental"" characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in ""Now Voyager."" In ""Casablanca"" we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to ""lower the key"" a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness.",10/10,26 August 2006,caa821,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
The Greatest,"What makes Casablanca the greatest?

The detail. After Ugate is arrested Rick moves forward and picks up a small glass that has fallen over.

When Sam is playing 'As Time Goes by' and Rick is drinking to forget (the famous scene) he involuntarily moans from within. He shows the man's heartbreak - the reactions of emotion running through a body broken by booze and sorrow.

This is acting and film making at it's very finest.

The inner decency of Rick is moving as is Ingrid Bergmann's tear filled eyes - but the throat catcher is the singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's impassioned 'Vive La France!'

This was war time, and the film makes us remember what it was all for. Hollywood should look at the script - how simply it is constructed - and learn - there is a public worldwide that wants scripts of this quality about real people.",No rating,20 July 2004,bob-1075,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Very enjoyable,"Being that it is a renowned classic I had a lot of expectations when going in to watch Casablanca. But if I'm being completely honest I believe that it was a bit over sold, not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie; I really did enjoy it. I found the plot of the movie to be very engaging and not too hard to follow and the acting was absolutely amazing. I thought there was so much to take in, which I really enjoyed and there many round characters that had great character development. I really enjoyed the character of Rick and how he progressed throughout the movie. I also very much so loved all of the quick witted humor that filled the movie and you either got it or you didn't, it wasn't highlighted at all. And besides the writing and the performances of the cast I really loved the lighting used throughout the movie and thought that it helped to amplify the story significantly. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and will most likely watch it again because I believe that there is a lot more that I could take from the movie, if I were to go back and re- watch it.

"Gonna get slammed for this, it was boring and corny.","Rating: 6.9

Going to get slammed for this review but I thought the film was boring and corny. Yes, the dialogue was witty, Richard was a believable and nuanced character, and the pro-freedom, anti-war themes were coherent and unheard of from a film released when people didn't know the Germans were going to lose WWII. But it just wasn't all that entertaining. It was predictable that Richard would save them all when characters keep telling us he's a sentimentalist and he continually helps others despite his cynical jaded posturing. The romance between Richard and Illsa felt corny and the whole time I was just trying to figure out what a ""non-occupied"" France means and why the Germans couldn't just take Lazlo or ask the police to contrive dirt on him to do it as they did in the third act sooner. They were planning to kill him anyway why wait? An influential movie that I just don't care to see again.

The thing is...,"Not as great as everyone says it is. But it's still pretty good. Bogart and Bergman ere nice. The writing is OK. Maybe I would've liked it more if not many people spoke so highly of it. Same goes for The Shawshank Redemption. Or Die Hard. Or Forrest Gump. People talk so much much about those movies and praise it to such a degree that anyone ho hasn't seen them gets these expectations to see one of the greatest movie of all time. I wouldn't call it one of the greatest, but I will say that it is required viewing for anyone who is interested in cinema. Just one of those movies that you need to watch, but no guarantee that you'll like. That kinda goes for every movie ever made. But hat can I say?

The most famed for many and one of the greatest movie ever realized,"Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .

Casablanca is homaged with fascination as in ¨One from the heart¨ (by Francis Ford Coppola) or from irony as ¨Play it again Sam¨(Herbert Ross). The movie has immortal images with memorable quotes and the best scenes ever written , such as the exciting final when Bogart bids Bergman farewell at the airport with ¨Here's looking at you kid¨still has audiences choking back a tear. All film originates unforgotten characters as makes with Wilson, the piano player to whom Ingrid Bergman says : ¨play it Sam¨. Bergman is enticing and wonderful , stunningly photographed by Arthur Edeson , she was fortunate to have Orry Kelly an hugely talented designer costume to dress her. His shone as radiantly as Bergman's luminous beauty who never looked lovelier. Along with a fabulous plethora of secondaries such as : Claude Rains , Paul Henreid , Conrad Veidt , Peter Lorre , S.Z.Sakal, Madeleine Lebeau , John Qualen , Dooley Wilson , among others . And a large number of extras , as in the famous scene where the ""Marseillaise"" is sung over the German song ""Watch on the Rhine"", many of them had real tears in their eyes ; they were actual refugees and Jews who had escaped from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out . The motion picture with sensitive score by Max Steiner was very well directed by Michael Curtiz . Well worth seeing for everybody and specially to the classic cinema lovers.",8/10,9 November 2005,ma-cortes,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
One of our most quotable movies,"Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing ""The World Belongs to Me."" See this if you never have.",10/10,9 March 2006,Hitchcoc,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Tough To Beat This Movie,"I am not getting into the ""The greatest picture of all-time"" debate. It's too subjective but if I forced to cast a vote, I would give this the most serious consideration. I mean, what aspect of this film isn't top-notch?

The dialog is superb, one of the best ever put on film. The acting is great, cinematography first-rate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama, action, romance, music...you name it. This film has everything but color, which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film- making doesn't get much better than ""Casablanca.""

All of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of all-time. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very, very enjoyable and the latest 2-disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.

Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, of course, are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar, essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are good-hearted people.

The ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman, despite being married, was willing to run off with Bogart, claiming she ""doesn't know"" what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well, judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years, maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway, other than that, this is a great movie with many, many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier, albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups, and Bogey was never more, well, Bogey, than in here. Add Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow, what a cast!

An added bonus is hearing ""As Time Goes By"" throughout the film, a haunting song. Actually, there are several songs played, mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson, and they're all fun to hear. As I said, one could go on and on about this movie. 'Nuff said.",10/10,8 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
TheMovieFrog Reviews: Casablanca,"To view the entire review, please visit us at www.TheMovieFrog.com

So, what do you write about a film that has been discussed and lauded for seventy years? Is it a timeless classic about love, loyalty, honor, and sacrifice or the greatest piece of corn-pone pro-war propaganda ever visited upon the American public? Well, the answer is yes...and yes. It is all of those things and more.

It is, first and foremost, a classic story of love and sacrifice, almost biblical in the way that it is layed out. Lazlo is the Christ- like figure. He has sacrificed everything: his safety, his freedom, and the purpose of his life to the cause of inspiring others to rise up and fight the Nazis. The only sacrifice he will not make is leaving behind the woman that he loves. Ilsa is his inspiration and the thing that keeps him going.

In turn, Lazlo's example of ultimate sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice for the greater good as well. His ability to inspire is demonstrated most dramatically and obviously in the scene where he leads all the patrons of Rick's in song. You can see in the faces of everyone joining in all the pain, fear, and uncertainty of living in a world turned upside down fade away to be replaced by a greater sense of pride and purpose. It is a very powerful moment in the film. However, this man's greater power is in how he impacts and inspires individuals from Ilsa, to Rick, to Renault. Rick has every reason to despise the man, yet it is not just Ilsa that leads him to break precedent and have a drink with the couple.

Is the film a little corny? Well, yes, but only in the best tradition of the time. The dialog is fantastic, but when every other line is a zinger, it does stretch believability a bit. No city has ever been populated by that many people who are that witty that much of the time. Yet the wordplay (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)

The movie that sort of saved my life,"The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.

I hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work.

Considering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation—well reasoned and timely— her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc.

Michael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind.

There's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue:

We'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."" Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism.

But just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this—according to the movie, crazy—world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day. Every-time when I am down or empty, or whatever they call it.

Finally, this timeless classic deserved not only three Academy Awards but definitely the remaining five nominations that it lost unjustifiably.",10/10,29 January 2014,EqbalAnwari,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE

WHY ???,"Why is everybody crazy about this film? I just find it a decent romance film (ah, it is very conventional and safe). I laughed out loud when I saw Casablanca listed #2 Greatest films of all time by the American Film Institute ( hey, how about Fight Club, American beauty, Mulholland Drive ? ). The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. ""Play it again, Sam"" for instance, what the hell? The line "" You jump I jump remember? "" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song ""As time goes by"". It is excellent.

Anyway, Casablanca is not too bad, quite enjoyable. I give it 6/10",6/10,1 October 2002,Betty_Bullock,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
A great love movie,"After watching this movie by myself, I have decided that if I was ever to watch this with a woman I definitely would win some major points. This is one of the best movies ever. Although it starts off slow, you really get into it. I have never seen such an excellent portrayal of forbidden love between two lovers. How could Bogart just walk away! I know I never could.

This movie really makes you associate with the characters and really become involved with them. I can't count how many times I became angry when she wouldn't just leave with Bogart. If you like great love movies or just great movies in general, this movie is for you. And guys, it wouldn't hurt to watch this with a special someone.

The Eyes Have It,"To get straight to the point as to why I don't give this special praise: it's obsolete. Not the plot - I mean the whole manner of storytelling. It's passé, where something like ""Citizen Kane"" still speaks to us.

The center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.

That said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. ""Here's looking at you"", indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.

And how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous ""As time goes by"" and ""La Marseillaise"" are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.

Worth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt.",6/10,9 September 2006,jldmp1,Casablanca (1942),POSITIVE
Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.

Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.

I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""",10/10,17 October 2005,ebiros2,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
One of the best movies ever made.,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.

This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.

If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.

The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.

What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.

The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.

No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.

It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.

A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.

"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely. ⭐","As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.

Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""

I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.

Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.

Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.

Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.

"Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.

You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.

On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.

The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.

I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.

Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.

"Stunning film, indeed. Without a doubt...","Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death.

Heart-touching,"You might not have heard about Oscar Schindler but you will definitely want to know more about him after watching the movie. He is credited with saving the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. He was named Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli Government a few years after the end of the Second World War. Righteous among the Nations is awarded to those non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust in various ways such as providing them food or shelter, arranging escape out of Germany and German- occupied territories, etc.

Schindler's List is based on a 1983 novel, Schindler's Ark. It tells the story of the efforts of Oscar Schindler, a German, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Played by Liam Neeson, Oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. It takes you time to fully understand who he is. He is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. He is an opportunistic businessman. He comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. But deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when Jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand Jews. He is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. You can see this in the movie when a Jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. At first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for Jews. But you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other Jews in his frustrated voice. Later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory.

The movie starts with how Oscar Schindler, in the midst of the Second World War, sets up a factory manufacturing pots and pans to supply to the German army. Oscar hires a Jewish accountant to manage the factory. While the account runs the factory enormously profitably for Schindler, he hires many Jews who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. By getting German SS guards to believe that they have the important skill sets required for the factory, he cleverly sneaks many Jews out of the concentration camps.

As Oscar is setting up his factory, the German SS is brutally evicting all the Jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. As Oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the Jews. The atrocities that the Jews face will touch your heart. In a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by German SS guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. He tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. The fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart.

As the war progresses, the state of the Jews worsens. The SS plans to exterminate all the Jews and hence gradually starts moving them from labor camps to concentration camps. Oscar's pots and pans factory are not considered important enough for the war effort to continue employing the Jews anymore but he is determined to keep the Jews in his factory, by now called Schindler Jews, from the concentration camps as he devises a new plan.

Despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humour. As Oscar's manager is cleverly hiring Jews in the factory by keeping the SS in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. The state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. But the subtle humour in the situation is difficult to miss when Oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory.

Overall, Schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. The movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. It is a must-watch. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10.

Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that.

Stunning; Spielberg's Greatest. Top 💯 All Time Best Films,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category.

don't take this personally,"Perhaps I should be shot, but I think four minutes of ""Springtime for Hitler"" is a more ingenious and powerful argument against anti-Semitism than four hours of ""Shoah.""

Many Jews attribute the resilience of their culture to a capacity for laughter in the face of catastrophe. As Saul Bellow said, ""Oppressed people tend to be witty."" Pogroms didn't start with Hitler; by the time the Spanish Inquisition burned a hundred thousand Jews, the story of Jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. Many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth: there are no Carthaginians left. There are no more Thracians to speak of. The Celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature, having been subsumed by their conquerors. Their gods are dead, and their languages, or nearly so. But the Jews thrive on. Something kept hope alive under Stalin, under Isabella, under the Caesars. A sense of humor is a great virtue, not to be undervalued.

But in order to make sure I appreciate the horror of the events portrayed, this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. The situations don't live as they might, because all the time I'm being flogged with message. There is no even partially redeemable Nazi in this movie, and Schindler's own late-stage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. And even melodrama need not be propaganda; Minnelli and Ray always left us with choices. But ""Schindler"" must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor, which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps.

The films of Bunuel and Altman are often political but rarely propagandist. The films of Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel are always propagandist and not always political, though they are of course always bad. So propaganda need not be political, and politics need not be propaganda. This shouldn't need saying, but in the modern age of American politics, it's worth remembering. I wish Steven Spielberg remembered it.

One can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective, a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. Propaganda is the use of art to persuade. It turns art into an expository essay. Propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form, limited by its very agenda. The tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter; the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. So I think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin, an overkill on the negative. I am not heartless; I hate hate as much as anybody, and I celebrate Jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. But is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours?

The fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. There is a decision made about every angle; literally, the perspective is chosen for the viewer. This is not the case with other arts, with musical performance, acting, writing, sculpture; but the more visual the medium, the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. It takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth, into a question rather than an answer.

You can make propaganda about love, like ""Love Story"" or ""English Patient""; you can make propaganda out of character, like ""Patton"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flag-waving and hate-mongering - what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. At its best, propaganda can remind us of our values, of our responsibilities, of our mythologies and potentials; and so it can be a great good. At its worst, propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium - it may be bland, dull, predictable. When it is these things, it is not very persuasive, and so it fails at its main intent.

In this light, ""Schindler's List"" is maybe the second-best type of propaganda. It has real emotion, a compelling story, myriad technical virtues; it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it, but of course I agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. The movie moves me to an extent. But it lacks comedy, the propagandist's most effective tool; and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity, it tells a half-truth.

Liam Neeson plays an excellent cad, and Ralph Fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. (It is among the many faults of the ""Harry Potter"" movies that they cut off his nose.) But I prefer ""The Pianist"" as a portrait of Nazi-occupied Poland. Aside from possessing greater artistic powers than Spielberg, Roman Polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. He does not preach, and he is not strident, and he is not sentimental. And he allows Adrien Brody to make me laugh occasionally, not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. Shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling; it is a view to a more realized universe. ""Jaws"" has it. ""E.T."" has it. But Spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the Holocaust would be in bad taste.

As far as propagandist filmmakers go, I'll take Charlie Chaplin or Paul Verhoeven. They are at least funny; the pill of ""Great Dictator"" or ""Starship Troopers"" goes down more easily, more persuasively, therefore more effectively, than the pill of ""Schindler"" or ""Private Ryan.""

"Schindler's List, or How I Learned to Stop Profiteering and Love the Jews","Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being ""deeply moved"" or ""touched.""

Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.

A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?

And what about Amon Göth, the representative Nazi? A ""grotesque caricature"" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why Göth hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.

The attempt to add depth to Göth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?

This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?

Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.

Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.

One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.

When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.

What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:

* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.

Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.

All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...

Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.

Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth.",5/10,2 August 2008,paladeen,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
A three hour film that feels too short,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.

Spielberg's most important work,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.

This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.",10/10,23 March 2014,SnoopyStyle,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE

Devastating,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.

The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.

Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.

Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.",10/10,23 October 2017,zaremskya-23761,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
Excellent - Spielberg's Best,"An incredible movie. One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting. Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human. He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic. Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man. This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives.

"Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.","SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.

Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'

The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand.

Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.

Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.

What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now.

Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.

Thoughts on Schindler's List,"This movie is visually stunning. Just the sheer mass of extras, set design, costumes, cinematography, and everything else that went into this movie is breathtaking. Through all this, the movie definitely pulls off a war-time atmosphere, the black & white photography only adds another element to this. The acting is (mostly) great. And the story is a good one and an important one. What Schindler did deserves our recognition, respect, and reverence. I'm glad Spielberg was able to bring it to our attention.

Now for the problems with this movie. First off, the length: I think this movie's 3 hour 15 minute runtime just snuck by Gandhi as the longest theatrically released movie in my viewing history. I try not to make a fuss over the length of a movie; however long the director requires to get their story across to the audience is up to them. What I do take issue with is a movie that has a 3+ hour long runtime that is completely unnecessary such as this one. This movie contains a story that doesn't need its allotted time. I think a 200 minute cut of this movie would really improve it, maybe even a straight 2 hours if you're pushing it. Too much time is taken replaying the horrors of Nazi-occupied Germany seemingly over and over again. I just want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish what happened or the emotional impact these scenes have, however when we as an audience are bombarded with scene after scene of tyrannical cruelty via the hands of the Germans, the emotional effectiveness of said scenes starts to fall under the law of diminishing returns. At a certain point, I as an audience member have no emotional energy left to invest and the effort Spielberg's putting into causing a mournful tone just becomes fruitless. With most things in life, overexposure will lead to dulling of the senses and emotional desensitization. I am aware that what is occurring on- screen is horrendous but my mind can no longer keep up with what is being presented. Sometimes less is more.

My next issue relates to the treatment of the protagonists and antagonists of this movie. No, there is no excuse for what the Nazis did and defending this party or their belief system is contemptible and disturbing. But as a director making an Oscar-winning Best Picture, please do not make your characters these black and white symbols of good and evil. Not every person in the Nazi regime was 100% certifiably evil; not every person representing the good guys was a sinless angel. It is up to you as a director to show us these characters, their nuances, their grey areas, and their stories as a whole. It is up to us as an audience to take in all of this and make decisions about these stories and their characters. But when a director paints all these characters in broad strokes, labeling everyone as either entirely pure or entirely evil, he or she has taken the decision out of our hands and we as an audience are forced to consume the subject matter from the pre-destined moralistic vantage point that the director has prepared for us. That is exactly what has happened here. Spielberg hold our hand through the entirety of this movie, not leaving anything up to the audience's interpretation or judgment. In Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"", we get to see the multiple dimensions to characters from this conflict. Polanski focuses more on the character development of the Nazis and Jews and less on the abhorrent crimes that were occurring. So, when we do see some kind of appalling act taking place on the screen, it is considerably more effect and haunting. But the point is that Polanski treats all characters, whether bad or good, like human beings. And, to me at least, it is much more frightening to see people with humanlike qualities behind these egregious acts of genocide. (See ""Downfall"" for another great example.) Spielberg's Nazis act more like monsters from some other dimension, far less unsettling.

Another issue I see with this movie is the character arc of our main focus, Oskar Schindler himself. At the beginning of this movie, we see a man who can be labeled as a womanizer, a drunkard, an opportunist, and someone who is self-centered and focused on personal wealth attainment. By the end of the movie we see a family man melodramatically balling his eyes out because he didn't give away enough of his wealth to save more Jews. (Did we really need that scene?) In theory this is a nice beginning and end point, however during the movie itself, we do not see exactly how this man went from being an egoist to a full-fledged humanitarian. Sure, the scenes involving the young girl with the red coat is supposed to represent a pair of epiphanies that Schindler has that alters his mindset similar to a Dickensian Scrooge. However, to me at least, these two scene do not do enough to cause me to buy this change. This movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes. We could spend a little of that time seeing Schindler's subtle changes over the course of the war. Instead we have this dramatic shift seemingly overnight that is difficult to swallow for me as an audience member. The character development just comes across as half-baked.

Despite all the gripes I have with this film, I still think Spielberg made a fine movie here. He told a beautiful story competently and with a few scenes that left me awe-struck. While the length of this film is a bit overwhelming, it is still something that I think everyone should see at least once, a very important piece of film history.

It's About Our Humanity,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",10/10,28 March 2006,Hitchcoc,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE

Color Choice = Genius,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this.

I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film.

Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed.

"Incredibly moving and visually disturbing, Spielburg's best by far!","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.

Thank you Spielberg,"An incredibly insightful film concerning the Holocaust. Spielberg recreates the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler - a man that would not typically be associated with savings the lives of people, as far as the Nazis were concerned, considered to be enemies of the State. Such a contrast makes the film so moving combining the horrors of what was experienced by the ethnic minorities under Nazi persecution with insight as to the atrocities that occurred in the gas chambers and ghettos to the generous, gentle nature of respected German businessman Oskar Schindler.

A tribute that will remain to be one of the most encapsulating films based around a remarkable man saving thousands of lives amongst one of the most devastating regimes witnessed by human history. A film that is to never be forgotten just as the Holocaust never will be.

Amazing 3 Hour History Lesson,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.He has directed family films (""E.T.""), horror films (""Jaws""), science fiction movies (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and even quite a few mature, adult dramas. ""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.

It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.

Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!

This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...

I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter.",7/10,20 September 2015,framptonhollis,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
Representation misused,"This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, ""Never Again"", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved ""one more"" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by ""It's A Wonderful Life"", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for us or at our disposal.",1/10,29 May 2006,Nerdboy1423,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
Eye opening,"This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding.

My absolute favorite movie capturing the history of WW2,"My first recollection of this movie was in my early adolescence, and of all the movies I've seen that portray historical events, Schindler's list is one that evokes the greatest emotion and most memorable impression. The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles. It gives descriptive recounts of how heinously and inhumane Jews were treated, with raw and unforgiving scenes unlike those seen in most factual films. This is truly one of Spielberg's best works of art.

"""The list is an absolute good, the list is life...""","Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.

Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".

""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'.

The score, the cast and the overall feel of the film is breathtaking and a film that should remind us all, that not only is it our job to remind our children of the horrors of Nazi Germany but never allow it to happen again.

Spielberg at his best,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.

The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general,"The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism.

The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);

1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.

2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e Lealtà"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth.

3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films.

4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.

5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary.

Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.",9/10,24 September 2017,Come-and-Review,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
Oskar Schindler: Good or Bad?,"At the beginning of this movie it was unclear to me whether Oskar Schindler was a good person or a bad person. Since he was German, my first instinct was that he was the enemy. However, as the plot progressed it was clear that he in fact was one of the good guys. He had an accountant who was Jewish but Oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. Schindler is unlike the other Germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person.

Great Movie,"It's a great movie and i recommended it to anyone who wants to see a beautiful film about the great tragedies of the holocaust. This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story.

No more than a useful public service announcement...,"Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.

Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.

Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement.",1/10,11 February 2002,lhhung_himself,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
Best Movie of all Time,"Perfect.

Perfect on every level from the acting to the script, to the cinematography, everything about this movie is 100% perfect.

I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.

An amazingly powerful film,"This is an amazing film in every detail. The acting is emotional powerful and extremely convincing. I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music). I will never not cry or be moved by this film.

Very accurate Portrayal by Ralph Fiennes,"Schindler's List,in my opinion, was a very accurate portrayal of the man and war themselves. I enjoyed the cast and was very gripped in the story right from the beginning thru to the very end,and that doesn't happen very often. World War II was very complex, to begin with, and when Oscar Schindler assisted with placing Jewish People in jobs, in order to keep them out of the Concentration Camps, that was the nicest thing anyone had done for them in a long time. The people he placed appreciated it,and he was a good employer as well.His friends didn't realize he was doing this,and I don't think they would have themselves. When the Nazis came and took some of the people who worked for him, he tried everything to keep them out of the camps.

My first Review,"Hello IMDb One of the most moving and captivating films I have ever seen, I would recommend it to anyone! It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centered around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again.

Black and White,"I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do. Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both. In neither case does he succeed. One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!",1/10,24 April 1999,Mr Lombardo,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
Emotional Release,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List. At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change. I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial. I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure. After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film. It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.

This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself. I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing. I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.

Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things. Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a pile of personal photographs of family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses. That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.

I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock. I was kind of mad at Spielberg. I mean, doesn't he know when to back off. It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.

Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.",No rating,31 March 1999,Docterry,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
My Response to Schindler's List,"What I learned about the Holocaust in the film 'Schindler's List' is that it teachers us about the horrors of the Holocaust and the nature of genocide. It also gave me the insight of what happened by showing a horrific number of deaths. The movie was shown through the eyes on the outside(Nazi's) and then through the eyes on the inside(Jews). This gave me more of an understanding. The first stage of the Holocaust was 'definition'. Jews were forced to wear the Star of David and shown as a threat. The second stage was 'segregation'. Jews were now forced into ghettos. The fourth stage was 'concentration camps'. Jews were sent to these camps to work and do free slave labor. The fifth stage was 'extermination camps'. Gas chambers were disguised as showers. By 1945, six million Jews were executed. The final stage was the 'aftermath'. Camps were liberated.

Oskar Schindler changed drastically from bad to good throughout the film. At the beginning Oskar was a greedy, money loving, womaniser but as the film progressed we were shown key moments that changed Oskar. The first key moment was when cities were being evacuated of Jews, Oskar see a little girl in red being evacuated and this left him shocked. The second key moment was when the bodies were being burned, Oskar noticed the very same red clothing the little girl was wearing. These moments, I think were major factors that led to his change.

Based on the events in this film, I do believe that one person can make a difference. I feel that Oskar was influenced by how the treatment the Jews were receiving etc. but also how the Nazi's were carrying on like animals, thinking they can do whatever pleased them. Oskar noticed all these actions and in a way he did act alone because he gave away personal items to get what needed to be done.

My own personal response to this film is that it was 100% worth the watch. All the awards the film won were all well deserved because in my opinion, it made me realize just how horrendous and cruel it all was. From an educational view, I think this is a film that every student should see because it is a major moment in history that will never ever be forgotten. The film was depicted so superbly.

Best of the best,"I was riveted from the opening scene to the closing credits where the live people from the Holistic were laying stones with Ben Kingsly. Don't plan on answering the phone or trying to squeeze dinner in while watching the movie. Nothing will be able to interrupt you. This was the first real taste I got of Liam Neeson. After that I made it a point to see some of his other films. A friend had told me about the filming of the shower scene and how hard it was to do it. I imagine the train scene was also very difficult as actors as well as all the crew behind the camera. I wish for this film to be shown in high schools because I never knew of this movement in WWII. At least there was some little glimmer of humanity in that war as this film shows.

A brilliant movie by Steven Spielberg !,"Directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg - Schindler's List is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. It is based on the life of Oskar Schindler – A German industrialist who saved the lives of more 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, by employing them in his factories. Set during the Holocaust in Nazi occupied Poland, the film is shot entirely in black and white. The film is a vivid portrayal of the persecution and mass murder that took place during the Holocaust- the monochrome making it's impact even more profound.

The film takes us through the transformation of Oscar Schindler. Initially focused only on making money, Schindler is profoundly affected when he witnesses the massacre in Kraków ghetto, particularly the death of a little Jewish girl in a Red coat- the only splash of colour in the film. He subsequently spends his fortune on saving as many lives as possible, lives of those he once exploited. Schindler continuously outsmarts the Germans by winning their friendship through bribery and flattery. The titular ""Schindler's List"" is a list of names, created by Schindler and his Jewish accountant 'Stern'. A Noah's ark of sorts – the list deems Schidler's Jewish employees as indispensable to his business, thus saving them from transportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp and subsequent death.

The soundtrack, composed by John Williams, befits the horror depicted in the movie. Spielberg manages to bring out the haunting history of the era with such subtlety and perfection that it lingers with the audience even after the movie. The black and white footage brings out the despair, hopelessness and gloominess better than today's visual effects would. I would rate the movie 5/5 stars. A winner of seven Oscars, this masterpiece is a must see for everyone.

"Schindler's List"" Review = Perfection.","Perfection.

There are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. In fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. Sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as ""Titanic"" and ""LOTR"" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. These are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. Finally, there are films such as ""Schindler's List."" Films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. ""Schindler's List"" is, indeed, an icon of American cinema.

Steven Spielberg's 1993 story of Oskar Schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the Nazi Holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history.

""Schindler's List"" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and I dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. It is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. Only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it.

There are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. They are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. ""Schindler's List"" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one.

Virtually every aspect of ""Schindler's List"" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. It would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection.

As Oskar Schindler, Liam Neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. Neeson offers a Schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. What makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...So often, in these humanity films we get a ""superhero"" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into Mr. Wonderful. Schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. It's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical ""tour de force.""

While Neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including Ben Kingsley as accountant Itzhak Stern, a man who works with Schindler yet remains wary of him and the Nazi's. Ralph Fiennes offers, perhaps, the ""tour de force"" performance as Amon Goeth, a sadistic Nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to Schindler.

The list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. The score of John Williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness.

The film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design.

Yet, in many ways, watching ""Schindler's List"" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. This film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...It is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. Yes, it truly is that grand.

""Schindler's List"" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. It is, in my opinion, Spielberg's finest work and one I doubt he will ever top. ""Schindler's List"" is more than a film...it is a life experience of such depth and beauty and greatness that I think it almost calls out for an 11th Commandment...Thou Shalt See ""Schindler's List.""",10/10,20 February 2016,aurora7459,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
A great film about one of the worst episodes in world history.,"A live film that transports the audience to a dark time when intolerance was taken its worst consequences. The film directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes deserve all the received awards, nominations and critical success achieved.

The Schindler's List tells the story of Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, a German businessman who during the Holocaust saved the lives of over a thousand Jews by employing them in his factory.

The film addresses the vision of two main characters antagonistic to one another, Oskar Schindler and the SS officer Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes. Throughout the movie is noticeable the conflict experienced by Oskar who finds himself in the dilemma between saving lives and keep your business out of sight of Nazi officials. The character Liam Neeson tries not to show their feelings to factory employees and presents the most of the time a serious man. The curious thing was that Oskar Schindler was a member of the Nazi party, a fact that leads him to escape the Red Army with the end of the German army and war, it is still noticeable humanity of his character in contradiction to Ralph Fiennes character.

Both main actors confuse the viewer a little early because of the physical resemblance of them. The look of the film, to be in black and white makes it seem more real scenes of a past that should not be forgotten. The girl in the red dress is one of the most intriguing characters in the film representing from the blood of the Jewish people to hope.

A long film that had to be split in two but that still was not enough to show all the suffering experienced by the Jewish people. Many stories are told throughout the film, a way to revive the memory of those who were in this sad episode in the history of the world.

One of the most beautiful scenes of the film, when Oskar needs to get away and all factory workers meets all their assets in gold, melt and transform into a ring given to Schindler in their match, he dressed in pajamas that thousands of Jews dressed. In this moment, Oskar gets emotional embarrassed, thinking he could have done more and thus save more lives.

The final finish is given in the last scene and more exciting when some of the characters in this tragedy played in the film comes up together in a field and find the actors that interpreted. Creepy.

Movies like this make us think how humanity can be cruel. Impossible not to be moved.

A film to watch over and over again,"The feelings I experienced while viewing this film are almost indescribable. I am an avid fan in World War II history but more specifically Holocaust history. It is my belief that humanity has a huge lesson to be learned from cowardly acts such as the Holocaust, and this movie has an uncanny way of helping pass the message along. This film shows human compassion even in the darkest of times. I do not think my eyes were dry at all during the movie-I found it so deeply moving. My rating of 10/10 originates from both the acting as well as the message gained. The movie will have a place not only on my shelf but also in my heart.

Difficult...but very necessary,"This is, after all, one of the more...for lack of a better word...*necessary* films to appear in recent years. Yes, humans can fall to such depths. Yes, such rampant disregard for all we hold sacred--for life, for simple virtues--is possible. Yes, such bestiality has been, is today, will be again. ...entertaining??? Perish the thought. Nothing, absolutely NOTHING about this movie is entertaining. If you want entertainment this evening, watch something else. A Cary Grant comedy, a Mel Brooks film...anything else.

But this is, when all is said and done, one of the most important films ever made...because it tells us something we need very much to know, or to remember: On your guard! There have always been, will always be more Amon Goethes!! There will always be more Auschwitzes! ...but will I have the courage to be another Oskar Schindler??

how one man made a difference,"The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.

The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.

It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work.",7/10,25 January 2005,didi-5,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
Indeed a masterpiece,"Excellent movie by Spielberg showing the horrors Jews had to go through in World war 2. Full credit to the crew for filming on (near) actual locations and also to the actors for their captivating performances. One of those movies that make you respect human life even more. Definitely recommended.

Great Drama,"Schindler's List is a great drama about the holocaust. It is both well written and directed. I haven't read the book or done much research. However it does tell a touching story of a man trying to save life in a very dark time in history. Steven Spielberg did an incredible job directing. There was so much detail in each scene. I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen. It ties with Saving Private Ryan as Steven Spielberg's best work. It is also one of the best movies from 1990's. It is a great movie.

Tragedy in the Mainstream,"The P.H. Metric 91/100 Directing: 9/10

A masterclass in direction. Spielberg's connection to the source material pushed him to make something that defies any sort of dilettante criticisms. Every decision from the black and white to the stones hits hard and hits well. Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.

Acting: 9/10

Liam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time. The rest of the cast offers more nuanced performances that really provide the viewer with a subdued approach to such horrors, allowing the audience to feel disconnected from the tragedy, yet thrust into its dark world.

Cinematography: 10/10

Red, red, red. Visually perfect.

Editing 10/10

Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.

Score: 10/10

Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.

Visual Effects: 8/10

The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.

Writing: 8/10

The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.

Production Design 9/10

Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.

Costume Design 9/10

Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.

Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10

Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white.",9/10,4 October 2017,poewilson,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
Extraordinary,"For me is a Spielberg's masterpiece. An amazing cast makes this one of the all time best movies.

There were many touching moments in the plot. Especially the closing scene, where Liam breaks down , simply heart touching.

~One of the Greatest Films of All Time~,"I know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that Schindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been. It does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe that Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection. The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather. Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus. There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece. 10/10 Absolutely Recommended!

Some thoughts,"SPOILERS WITHIN. Don't read unless you've seen the movie.

At this point, almost a decade after its release, Schindler's List is what it is: it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. It certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, I plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts I had while watching it. Some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what Spielberg has achieved with this movie.

First off, I must say that all the scenes with Schindler himself I found riveting: Liam Neeson - not an actor I usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing: he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (He reminded me again and again of a young Richard Burton when he was at the top of his game.) The tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and Stern (Ben Kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. Holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and Schindler's List is no exception: scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur.

One scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. It is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan), but its reason for being I found suspect. Ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring Schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the Nazi policy toward the Jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to Jewish savior.

Except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. Schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. No, this scene is designed not to be played before Schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers.

So why does that bother me? Well, it seems to me a break in form. A movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the Holocaust. Problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so Spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of `ghetto'-izing the Jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals.

My bias, I suppose, in films dealing with the Holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. It's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. Therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. Not that Holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is Spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *SUGGEST* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. Actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, `inside' the Holocaust) is frankly impossible, and I think Spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed.

But, as I say, when he's focused narrowly on Schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the Holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) `herd up the Jews' scenes. The making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard: `More names! More names!' Schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself).

And as such, I must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - Schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. To me, it was the best scene in the movie. For, in the character's hysterical insistence that he `could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *DID* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what Oskar Schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and/or disrupted by the Holocaust. That this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the Jews - could claim that he `didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. That, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the Holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. We can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie). The point made through Schindler's breakdown at the end is the deepest kind of truth - the kind that never should be forgotten or cast aside.

Can we criticize this movie now?,"I mean, has enough time passed? Or has the release of *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?

Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama. I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie. Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable. Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject: Francesco Rosi's *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras' *Amen"". Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama. (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.) For that matter, Polanski's *The Pianist* gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with: a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who, despite all the war-profiteering (read: ""initiative""), turns out to have a heart of gold. Or marshmallow mush. Please don't bother pointing out that this is a ""true story"": those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for ""dramatic license"". The biggest example of this is the ""villain"" of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance). The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning: he's crazy as a loon. So much for the ""banality of evil"": instead, we get, via Fiennes' Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity. Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite ""Hath not a Jew eyes"" speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes. Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard ""Lifetime Channel"" movie about an abusive husband.

Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time: even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in *Schindler's List* are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving ""Schindler Jews"" appear (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them. They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave. Moving stuff. Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention. And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question: this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed. The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz: it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.

But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre. It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders: ""Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today."" Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance? You decide.",3/10,2 March 2004,FilmSnobby,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
One of the ultimate anti-war movies,"SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil.

well done,"One of the on living legendary pieces made ever, you could easily cry, it is one of the movies I discovered way later only realizing that not every one of the people working with the Germans was bad, there were a few good ones.

Also the dominant use of hard light in the film gave it the old 40's mood and vibe that made us feel as part of the people in that time.

It is also interesting how the director chose to high light the girl in red a color that stood out in black and really made it very powerful.

It was interesting to discover how good of an actor liam Neeson is given that time, because to be honest most people knew him from the film ""Taken"" at least for average movie watchers.

Perfection.,"Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be. Aside from all the details, the story is one of few that really got to me, and in the end that is why I must say it is the greatest movie of all time.

Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. ""Schindler's List"" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.

"Its gonna be our next generation's classic. Deep, solid, and undoubtedly immutable !","Schindlers list is one of movie which depict the true skill of our legendary Spielberg. Shot in black and white, Spielberg want to present the classic vintage and dramatically dark of world war 2 history. I should say this is the best movie which Spielberg made from perspective of cinematography, casting, and art direction. Yes, this is a near perfect movie.

Storytelling of the movie itself constantly shuttling from deep to solid. The writing definitely gives Neeson to dig his character fastidiously. While the antagony delivers dogmatic and deleterious performance, the protagony also delivers benevolent and empathetic character. Well, i should say Spielberg seldomly made a real serious movie here, but when he did, it was terrific.

Inspirational, this movie keeps deliver a solid writing, tough performance, and precious cinematography. This is one of movie that could change people. This movie have such magnificent power to do that while have a self-perpetuating charisma to stand as classic.",10/10,2 June 2016,the-fearless-america,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
"Spielberg makes a masterpiece for the times, driven by emotion and loyalty towards history, it's victims and characters.","Steven Spielberg is a known director. Most of his works focus on adventures, genre movies, be it with children, explorers or Extra- Terrestrial beings. So, when Spielberg decides to focus on historical dramas, usually based on true events, we can see the full array of his abilities and capacities.

Schindler's List is a movie that occurs during the holocaust, and this time period serves as background for characters study. Spielberg was smart enough to realize that such a theme could not be tackled head on. Instead, the focus is on the humans of the time. Why they did what they did, how could they and, specially, how they endured it.

The narrative focus on the actions of ""entrepreneur"" Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). How he dealt with the holocaust and how he was touched by the Jews situation after seeing their torment and suffering. He had to take care to not have such a feeling be discovered by any of his many Nazi friends, such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).

Being a Jew himself, Spielberg finds the fine line between homage to those who died and survived without falling in any melodrama. Spielberg is, above all, a director. And a director has only one obligation: to make a good film. Even though directors are human beings, Spielberg is professional enough to know how much he really must use of his emotion, sensibility and identification with the victims of the holocaust.

It's safe to say that this is one of the best Spielberg films. For many, like me, his best. A historical piece with much to add in the discussion of mankind tragedies.",10/10,20 July 2016,leonardoanamorim,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
'THE' Best Masterpiece of all Time.,"Its an irony that though I am an avid watcher of good and excellent movies, I only happened to watch this MASTERPIECE in 2002 even though it was produced in 1993.And I am repenting for the nine years I wasted in between, before I watched this MASTERPIECE in an Oscar festival in a local theatre here in Mumbai.

This movie is one of my most favourite masterpieces(mind you,I am saying 'masterpieces' and not 'movies' because I have painfully selected my 'favourite' masterpieces from all the movies I HAVE watched, and then AGAIN filtered and selected my 'personal 40 most favourite MASTERPIECES of all time' from those favourites).

' SCHINDLER'S LIST ' is my choice along with Life Is Beautiful(1997); The Sixth Sense(1999); The Godfather 2(1974); Braveheart(1995); Se7en(1995); Crimson Tide(1995); Unbreakable(2000); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000); The Great Dictator(1940); Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991); Dog Day Afternoon(1975); Kramer Vs.Kramer(1979); Saving Private Ryan(1998); Artificial Intelligence(2001); Raging Bull(1980); Philadelphia(1993) and many more ...!

Usually, I don't approve myself of providing ranks to my 'personal 40 Favourite Masterpieces of All Time' but this one is an EXCEPTION and I rank this movie as 'The Number One'.

My humble suggestion : 1. To all those who had the luck of watching this masterpiece before - DON'T WAIT. GO and BUY a CD or a DVD whatever you get your hands on and enjoy this movie for your lifetime. 2. To those who haven't yet watched IT - DON'T WAIT, GO and RENT IT / watch IT in a theatre on the very first chance you get. And now PLEASE don't complaint of not having enough money to buy or even rent it. SELL YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE.

The magic trick of Schindler's list,"It was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and Spielberg knew it. This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.

While Schindler and Goth battle it out miles above the Jews like New Gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the Jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. It is Itzhak Stern ( Ben Kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified Stern is a Jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the Nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to.

It is through Stern that we see the transformation in Schindler, as first Stern will not even take a drink with Schindler by the end Stern looks at Schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people.

We see the slow transformation of Schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the Polish countryside, it is here that Schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by Hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for Schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. Her life snuffed out like a candle. This is the moment when Schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting.

From that moment on Schindler is relentless in protecting his Jews, the Schindler Jews, he overcomes every obstacle the Nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. But not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. The Nazi's were relentless in their thirst for Jewish blood and Schindler had to be just as relentless.

A masterpiece and a historical look at Mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the Nazis thought their Reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. Thankfully there were men like Schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be.",10/10,21 April 2017,hacoach,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
"Fascinating tale about the hope of life and the promise of safety linked to one man and several thousand others, unfolding amongst an ocean of carnage.","Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.

Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.

Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.

The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.

Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon Göth (Fiennes), Göth additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, Göth is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. Göth arrives on the scene, a Kraków suburb called Płaszów, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work – construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, Göth himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as Göth is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out.",7/10,25 October 2010,johnnyboyz,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
An upbeat holocaust movie?,"Only Stephen Spielberg could make a film about the holocaust where the point is that none of the major characters do NOT die. To me the message is lost because of this and the film becomes a glorification of one man surrounded by the deaths of millions. Oscar Schindler was a Nazi embroiled in the holocaust and the second world war. He managed to save his friends, yet profited from concentration camps. Ok, so he wasn't an anti-semite bent on destruction, but he only saved people he was connected to, and their families.

And the evil Nazis in this film are all slightly comical. Where is the evil? Where is the horror? Where is all the death and torture and misery.

Scrape the surface of this film and you find a gratuitous ""entertainment"" movie. If you want to know about the holocaust watch Shoah.

My review of Schindler's List,"Schindler's list gave me some insight on how Jews were treated out of concentration camps in Nazi Germany. This film is about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who starts a company making silverware using unpaid Jewish labor during the Nazi regime. Overtime as Schindler develops empathy towards his workers. Schindler moves his factory and his workers back to his hometown in Czechoslovakia and waits till the war blows over. During the process of aiding the Jewish people, Schindler spent millions of Reich marks in order to feed and save 1100 Jews. This movie The Nazi soldiers would abuse Jews by cutting their hair, push them around, or even killing them. Jews were forced to wear a Star of David and were obliged by law to inform German men that they are Jewish. This film shows us how Jews were forced to change their usual practices in daily life. This is depicted in the scene where Schindler tells the Rabbi that he should be preparing for the Sabbath since it is Friday evening. This is also seen when the Jews are celebrating and they break the glass. Overall I believe that this was a fantastic film that was very educational about the Holocaust and the Jewish faith, and also an inspiring humanitarian.

A Conversation That Probably Didn't Happen,"Though I rather like to think it did.

There is a moment at the end of the movie where Oskar is about to leave in order to escape being arrested. He is surrounded by the Jews and is accompanied of course by his wife.

The dialogue is as such (according to the quotes page):

Oskar Schindler: I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just... I could have got more.

Itzhak Stern: Oskar, there are eleven hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them.

Oskar Schindler: If I'd made more money... I threw away so much money. You have no idea. If I'd just...

Itzhak Stern: There will be generations because of what you did.

Oskar Schindler: I didn't do enough!

Itzhak Stern: You did so much.

*Schindler looks at his car*

Oskar Schindler: This car. Goeth would have bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there. Ten people. Ten more people.

*removing Nazi pin from lapel*

Oskar Schindler: This pin. Two people.This is gold. Two more people. He would have given me two for it, at least one. One more person. A person, Stern. For this.

*sobbing*

Oskar Schindler: I could have gotten one more person... and I didn't! And I... I didn't!

~

It is during this moment that Oskar appears to have a moment of so much regret and remorse and yet, you can't help but think--Oskar, you did something! You did something more than so many people bothered to do.

And that is better than doing nothing at all, no?

So, I give this movie (though it is a ruthlessly manipulative Spielberg adaptation) ten stars, for this scene more than any other scene in the entire film.

I do not know (and to some extent highly doubt) whether this conversation actually took place.

But despite the fact that I know deep down it probably did not, I like to imagine it did. And I like to imagine that even if it didn't, the emotion behind it was present during the actual event that this scene portrays.

It is this that makes me feel as though this movie deserves the ten star rating. This scene alone. Even if it is perhaps the most manipulative scene in the entire film, I can not describe how deeply I love this scene. How much I cried over this scene.

Again, I realize this is the talking-down-to-the-audience technique so often seen in such big blockbuster historical non-fiction films like this, but I can not help but feel so much for just this one particular moment and I guess I can not explain why. I hope that the quote itself explains it enough.

And I hope whoever sees or has seen this movie will perhaps understand why this scene is so important.

At the present time I am in the process of reading the book from which this movie is adapted and eventually perhaps I will see the documentary.

But for now, this is something.

Oskar, you did something!

Steven Spielberg's greatest cinematic achievement,"In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making.

Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.

Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events.

Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust.

Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.)

Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars.

I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.

Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)

A Most IMPORTANT Film,"A fellow reviewer started his review of ""Schindler's List"" almost on the defensive, with an assumption that others might be critical of his determination of this film as one of the greatest, that he would place it ""up there"" (my words) with ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane.""

I'm going to contend that ""Schindler's"" is not only among the greatest, it goes down in historical terms as perhaps one of the most important films ever made. This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.

The cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope.

The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, ""Schindler's List"" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer.",10/10,25 April 2017,funsterdad,Schindler's List (1993),POSITIVE
World Religions Movie Review,"Movie Review - Schindler's List

Schindler's List is captivating because the story it tells, the characters it portrays and the way it was shot feels very real to the audience. Why the Nazis had persecuted the Jews was not explained, however, throughout the movie, the audience are reminded how the Jews are not considered as people but inferior beings. All the Nazis believed this, with the exception of Schindler, he befriended his Jewish accountant; he showed empathy towards his workers; he even kissed a Jewish girl. Schindler saw the Jews as people and as his peers, to all the others they were an inferior life form, to be exterminated.

The movie was mainly shot in black and white, conveying a mood of bleakness and hopelessness. The most memorable use of color is the red coat worn by a little girl, seen by Schindler during the evacuation to the camps and again seen by him in a pile of burning corpses.

The main characters were developed in depth and detail. Schindler's character changed from a greedy businessman to someone who spent all his money bribing the 'list makers' to save as many Jews as possible. The mood intensifies as the Jews realizes that they are being systematically killed, and, that the Nazis are slowly loosing their grasp on their humanity as they indiscriminately kill all the prisoners. In the end, the audience are reminded that although unbelievable, these events are real and that real people are depicted in the movie.

The best lesson for everyone,"Regarding to the history and background during the war, this film totally inspired all humans which should do the right things by their own choice and braveness.

Plus, I love background music which totally fit with all atmosphere of film.

This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.

One of the best Holocaust movies,"Schindler's list takes a look into one of the most compelling visual pieces of the Holocaust. The black and white movie will take you into a journey of what it was like for Schindler and his thought on hiding Jews during the 1940s. You will love the ending and will feel the horrors experienced by the Jewish people during this time. There is a small splash of color in this movie which is figurative once you see it. This film will take you through a range of emotions and will impact your take on what people had to do to survive. The movie is a must see for all adults and is a completely true story. It is perhaps one of my favorite films.

"""This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.""","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.

Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Kraków Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""

It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.

With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a Hauptsturmführer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""

This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.

Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker  with such adventure classics as ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm.

thought provoking,"I finished watching schindlers list today and it was the first time i had seen it. It was tragic in places and extremely upsetting in others. Liam neeson did a great job as oskar schindler. He played the part excellently.

The holocaust is a depressing subject to say the least but what made this film more poignant was that it's based on a true story. The end of the film was extremely moving and the whole film in general was very moving. The lengths he went to to save his workers were amazing.

I really liked this film. Its not one id watch all the time but not because i don't like this because its one of them you have to be in the mood for it.

Id give this film 9 out of 10. Its a moving film based on a tragic true story. Schindler saved over a thousand people and he was a German who went out of his way. Despite his political beliefs and faults, he did everything he could to save those who worked for him.

Extraordinary pictures - not so great script,"It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by IMDb comments: either they label it ""masterpiece"" or ""a sappy, manipulative banalization of the Holocaust"". Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.

Unfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? And then ""La Amistad"", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).

And then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. In Schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. ""What can we do"" ""If I were you, I wouldn't go East. They don't like you there. Neither I would go west"". Next scene: we see all the survivors in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS. In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT dumb?",7/10,27 July 2007,buzoncontacto,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
This goes beyond being just a bad film.,"As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.

What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.

Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime.",1/10,7 March 2002,dawidbleja,Schindler's List (1993),NEGATIVE
The Perkins Factor,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",10/10,27 July 2009,mark-lovellsamuels,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
It's the Little Things,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

B.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

C.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

D.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

E.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

F.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

G.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.

Anthony's Norman,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.",10/10,19 May 2017,arichmondfwc,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Hitchcock and Herrmann,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car...",10/10,23 November 2007,littlemartinarocena,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"The More I See This, The Better It Gets","When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.

I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also, this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences, either, not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.

But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.

""Norman Bates"" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. ""Norman"" is a nutcase, as it turns out and the more you know all about him, the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character ""Norman"" in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.

What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD. Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.

The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked, the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally ""screams"" at you.

I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list.

Always holds me from beginning to end...,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.

This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises.

The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns.

Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search.

The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.

This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem.

Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.",10/10,25 March 2017,AlsExGal,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Movie At The Crossroads Of Time,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.

Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.

You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.

Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.

He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.

If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.

It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.

Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.

Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",10/10,10 August 2004,slokes,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Curtains...,"An opportunity presents that can't be ignored, to escape from a world that's been making you bored, with dollars galore you ride out of town, pestered by a copper, who keeps hanging around; you seek to find shelter, somewhere to hide, the motel of Bates is the one that you've spied, there's a curious fella who's friendly, polite - you pay him for a room, and will stay for a night; after saying goodnight you retire to room, then into the bath for a showery flume, but before you're all clean you get into a lather, as the curtain is shred, by a bit of a slasher.

Still a wonderful piece of filmmaking all these years later.

Hitchcock did it all in this one.,"When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake was complete trash.

The Greatest Horror Film Ever,"When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.

Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).

The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.

I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists.",No rating,17 January 1999,Popenoe,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
An intelligent thriller/horro,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film

Two Words: Hitchcock's Best (...and you know that's no small feat!),"Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.

If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.

""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.

""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.

Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.

Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.

One more thing...

Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.

I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.

I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.

First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.

What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.

One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it.

"Good, but overrated and unintentionally funny","""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.

I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.

The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.

The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.

Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.

And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.

It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?

And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?""

Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.

""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great.",5/10,22 July 2007,stevenfallonnyc,Psycho (1960),NEGATIVE
A Hitchcock Masterpiece.,"Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer, running away from suspicions and her own guilt, she checks into The Bates Motel, a quiet, out of the way establishment, run by Norman Bates.

Oh boy, this film is quite something. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.

What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.

Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.

There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.

Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.

The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.

One of my top ten greatest film of all time.

Perkins Is Remarkable,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits. Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath. One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.

Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling. He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).

Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",9/10,12 September 2000,darkjosh,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Perkins Irreplaceable?,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role. At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely: Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper. However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him. Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""? Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks. Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"". I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then. Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job.",10/10,1 October 1999,Whizzer-2,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Hitchcock makes a masterpiece,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. I have seen all of his movies, and think all of them are excellent. This one, however, is at the top of the food chain. Psycho is brilliant. Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb. Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates. He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time. When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine. ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes."" At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins. What makes this movie so great is its originality. Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one. The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived. I could just go on and on about what a great movie this is. My grade: A+

This is what good movies are all about.,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.

I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.

The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created.

Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone.

Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever.

The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.

Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie.

I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see.",10/10,25 November 2000,llihilloh,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
The scariest ever...,"I saw this movie as a teenager when it was first released in the 1960's. The promotional hype for the film ensured you did not have a clue what it was about and people who had seen the movie were asked not to reveal the ending. You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.

The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled. The characters were great, the direction perfect and the music, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, made this a classic.

I still get scared when I see it on TV.

One of the greatest horror/suspense films ever!,"Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.

Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.

She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a ""private island"". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.

Marion's boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to ""talk"" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you, I'm just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think. Over 40 years and this film is still horrifying as if it were made today!

The greatest Thriller/Horror ever created !,"The first Alfred Hitchcock film I saw was The Birds and I thought it was a film which couldn't be beaten in its genre, until I saw, ""Psycho."" (There are a few spoilers here.) Horror films usually leave you cold and chilled and as shocking and disturbing Psycho is, it's a film you can somehow warm to. The shower scene is a scene like no other. Its more shocking than frightening, the instant when the curtain draws back and you are faced with a shadowy figure clutching a knife sucks the adrenalin out you like a sponge, after Marion is viciously stabbed she clutches the shower curtain and falls to the floor, so simple yet so powerful. The full story which is one that you really need to know nothing about to get the full affect. Unfortunately I knew quite a bit about it before I saw it. If there ever was a film with a plot twist this film would top the list. If you haven't seen it then go, go, go and rent it now, in fact buy it ! You won't be disappointed.

Hmm;,"A lot of people have different opinions on this, mines rather mixed. There is only one bit of this movie i didn't fully understand (and I may sound completely dumb for mentioning it, it's probably something rather easy to understand!) but in the film, the male hotel keeper carry's his mother down the stairs after asking her to hide and you can see him carry his mother down stairs but later on in the movie the policeman says he dressed up as his mother and acted like her etc? If that's so, who was the women that he carried down the stairs? All in all, it's an alright movie, most of the women really reminded me of Marilyn Monroe It's a good old horror though! :)

A flawed classic,"1960 was in a way the beginning of modern horror. Before that, horror movies featured monsters and mythical creatures, and monster movie was synonymous with horror movie. This all changed in 1960 with the release of this movie and the inferior, controversial, career-destroying Peeping Tom. These movies showed the worst kind of monster: a human being.

The plot follows that Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles money for herself and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She stays overnight at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). It's not a surprise to anyone that Norman Bates is the villain of the movie. That is one of the primary problems with this movie: Norman is the only likable character in the entire movie. He's handsome, but shy and misunderstood, so he can't have a relationship outside of his voyeuristic fantasy life. This is a grave contrast to Marion Crane, a sleazy, immoral character.

All is going well to this point; it looks like it might get interesting, but starting with Marion's murder, it takes a 180. Her murder is one of the worst (not most brutal) I've ever seen. While the killer is supposed to be stabbing her to death, the camera jerks all over the place. Epileptics should definitely skip this part. John Carpenter did a far better, less obvious obscuring of graphic murders 18 years later in his Halloween.

The movie then goes from bad to worse, as we observe some of the going ons in a small town, with Sam and Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles). Here is where it gets really boring, showing us inconsequential pieces of small-town life. Unlike Halloween, which was based on the introduction of a madman into the everyday life of babysitters, Psycho's second half is little more than filler. There is essentially no connection between the first half and the second or between the second half and the first. It just meanders for a half hour or so.

The climax really comes out of nowhere. The special effects aren't that good (in fact, they're awful), but it is the best part of the movie: Sam tackling knife-wielding, cross-dressed Norman and the following scene providing a glimpse into Norman's mind, something that nothing before that had done.

"A film that you see once, and never forget...","I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.

Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.

The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.

Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10/10,9 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"Great movie, kept me guessing till the end.","I saw Psycho last night at the campus movie theatre and it was great, not to mention scary. I mean I had never seen it before (except for parts on TV when I was small) and had no clue about the plot or the ending. Untill the final scene I still thought it was the mother. Now I'm one of those guys who can pick out the ending like half way through the film, but Psycho had me fooled all the way to the end. Psycho may be great to watch again and again, but its even better the first time.

Hithcock masterpiece in his most accomplished and perfect movie,"This famous film with known story tells about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) , she works in a Phoenix (Arizona) office, when his employer trusts her some money . Seeing the opportunity to take the cash and beginning a new life along with her fiancé Sam (John Gavin) . Larcenous Marion leaves Phoenix and heads with her car towards California where her lover with debts is owner a store . When is caught in a storm and pursued by a policeman , she leaves the highway and enters Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young (Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother , she's living at a creaky mansion nearly hotel. Then, rare things start to happen . Later on , a detective named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) , her sister (Vera Miles) and Sam (John Gavin) are looking for Marion , asking for help a stubborn sheriff (John McIntire).

¨Psycho¨ was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful movie , but was a phenomenon in its own right . The picture is a magnum opus in the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It's the quinta-essential shocker that created an authentic sub-genre about psycho-killers and continuing until nowadays . The shower image is one of the most studied , copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself . Terrific performance by Anthony Perkins in an immortal role as Norman Bates and sensational Janet Leigh with Oscar nomination included that was the only one in her long career. Inventive and superbly constructed plot , filled with delicious black humor by writer Joseph Stefano based on Robert Bloch's novel. The highlight of the film is , of course , the shower scene , it was made with 70 cameras to shot the 45 seconds of footage and the creepy sound effects were realized by stabbing a knife into a melon . Magnificent credit titles by Saul Bass , he's usual on Hitchcock films .

Excellent black and white cinematography by cameraman John Russell , as Hitch thought it would be very gory in colour . Bernard Herrmann's legendary musical score copied and endlessly imitated , aids to create a thrilling atmosphere . Film is directed with exquisite taste and intelligence by master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions , infusing with a deliciously macabre wit , it makes ¨Psycho¨ far superior to the several movies what tried duplicate , or imitate it ; these are the following ones : ¨Psycho II¨ (1983) by Richard Franklin , ¨Psycho III¨ (1986) by Anthony Perkins himself and for cable television : ¨Psycho IV¨ (1990) by Mick Garris. Hitchcock's Psycho belongs to his best period in the 5os and 60s when he produced his finest works , perfecting the art of suspense in a series of masterpieces : ¨Dial M¨, ¨Rear window¨, ¨Vertigo¨, ¨North by Nortwest¨, ¨Birds¨ and specially ¨Psycho¨ , all of them are still studied and copied today . Rating : Indispensable and essential classic movie.",8/10,26 June 2007,ma-cortes,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"Legendary, in both a good and a bad way","Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before. Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree. The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved. Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck. He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity. Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.

In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend. I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly. Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure.

It was a dark and stormy night...,"(((((SPOILERS))))

For most people, the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, indeed it's most famous scene, is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm.

For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her ""private trap."" Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon.

Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.

The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next.

I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents....."" Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist.

And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film.

On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.

And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.

It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.

The Best In Its Time,"This movie is the best movie by Alfred Hitchcock ever. That is hard to do to. Because he did all the good scary movies back then such as Rear Window and The Birds. I loved it I own the movie and parts 2 and 3 I like the shower scene. Another good thing about this movie was that it had a good back ground the motel off the main highway and the creepy old house on the hill behind the motel this was scary for its time but not now. However it still is a real good movie a classic. The remake was ok but it can't match to this one.

To those sad few who think the movies like Gacy, Ed Gein, and Dahmer are of some quality, please burn those movies and simply watch a good movie about a killer ... PSYCHO! If you want to watch a good story about John Wayne Gacy, I'm sure one on A&E will be on any day now! Watch a documentary if you want the facts, if you would rather watch serial killers for entertainment, at least watch a movie with some quality and one that doesn't live off the infamy of the subjects last name!Check out my more in-depth review on my site timothynoble.com!

Hitchcock At His Very Best,"Psycho is the all time greatest movie ever made in movie making history. It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film. There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture. Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10.

"""we all go a little mad sometimes""","One of the few movies that deserve to be a classic. The acting game was on such a good level and there was intense during the whole movie. Maybe I should watch it a second time cause I want to see the things that Norman says in another perspective after I know that he killed his mother. Oh, and let's not forget about the last scene! Such a masterpiece! Definitely not a horror though but a true thriller!

film isn't as good as the novel,"When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are much better directors, in my opinion. Sorry for my English. I'm from Russia.

"Hitchcock's ""Crazy"" Film!","One of my favorites and I think Hitchcock's best film. Made relatively low-budget with his TV-show crew, this movie has haunted me for years and not because of the shower scene. Actually, the best scene is just prior to the shower scene and it's in the parlor with Norman and Marion. The only human connection moment in the film that doesn't show selfishness or ulterior motives. Quiet and full of info, as the camera looms over them, this scene is masterful in writing and acting. Perkins gave his best performance as the timid and lonely Mr. Bates who really is clueless. Janet Leigh is perfectly cast as the sexy, intelligent woman in over her head. The rest of the cast is top-notch and this film should have cleaned up at the Oscars in '60, but was considered too creepy for most folks.

A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Perkins. Brilliant editing and cinematography (b/w) with The Bates Motel a wonderful set. This film is highly undervalued and I don't consider it a horror film. Dashed illusions, loss of essence, and money-will-fix-it attitude while suspicions fly all over the place. Great stuff!

"""A boy's best friend is his mother. ""","Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.

Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.

This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.

What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.

One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft.",10/10,21 October 2013,AgentDice,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"Technical excellence, at its best.","Ever wonder what the movie history would be like, if the ""genius"" of Hitchcock, were never brought to silver screen? Aside from the story line, the cast, and the acting, the highest point of this film, to myself, is the camera direction. Being a past film and tv school grad', all I can say is, this one is a masterpiece. The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie. To see what Im saying, when next shown, turn the volume off, and just let the camera , under his direction, tell you the story. I believe one will get a different understanding of this film, and a greater appreciation of the director.

One of the best movies ever made!,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**

This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!

Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!

A Perfect Film.,"Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing. Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959. Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal. Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" because many film executives didn't like the material. Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented. At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers. It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.

PSYCHO is perfect because: 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)

2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting. (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)

3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters. This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)

4) The shower scene, of course. Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)

5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the ""old house on the hill"" and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it. (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)

6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror. (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)

7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly. (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)

Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time? I don't think so. Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.

RATING: 10+

"Timing, Hitchcock made it special.","In reading the comments of some, I think that to have seen Hitchcock's Psycho when it opened in '60, is to fully understand its impact today. It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the ""boy next door,"" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets. Ironically, in Psycho 3 (?), a character was killed while on the toilet. The remake of two years ago sucked--big time. Hitchcock's Psycho not only had the master at the helm, but it was also a matter of timing in cinema history. Those elements cannot be duplicated.

Still one of the scariest films to date; Hitchcock's best film,"Psycho is an extremely suspenseful, scary and wonderful film. For being filmed in Black and White, it also has an artistic feel to it like all Hitchcock films. The acting, dialogue and filming in this film are fantastic, something that feels it shouldn't be out of 1960 but is. At the end, (which I won't spoil) I was absolutely shocked, to say the least I didn't see it coming.

Psycho is easily Hitchcock's best film and if you haven't watched it I would highly recommend.

Tight and Terrifying,"When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling.

The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:

1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.

2. The scene with the patrolman.

3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.

4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.

5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).

6. The ""conversations"" with Mother.

7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.

What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film.

MJM REVIEW,"Finally! After all these years, I've managed to find the time to give this highly rated movie a try. For a movie lover, I suppose that's shameful, hahaha. One of the reasons is just a matter of not being alive when it was released..... I mean it was made over 60 years ago, and although I do love the classics. I've just never got around to this particular one.

I didn't know what to expect, really. Its reputation precedes itself, so on one hand I had high hopes and on the other, I had a feeling I wouldn't like it for some reason. Maybe that's why I have held off on watching it all this time. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised and actually enjoyed it. Especially considering my mindset is different from those who watched it upon release back in 1960.

My generation and others have been spoiled by this genre. What I mean by that is we have seen it all, in terms of narrative, special effects and modern approach. Sound effects / Special effects are at the forefront of thriller/horror movie production, even to this day. They have come a long way since 1960. Imagine watching any of the classic horror movies over the years without all the sound effects that come with them. They say we are all born with two fears. The fear of Falling and loud noises. Production companies have obviously caught on to this years ago, but Alfred Hitchcock set the standard and did the best with what he had at his disposal.

I always think directors and filmmakers back then deserve way more praise for what they achieved under the circumstances. Producers have an easy job with all the top spec computers and a boat load of other tricks and technology they have to create the scare fest's we see nowadays. That said, It is getting harder and harder for producers to scare people easily in this day and age. This film in a way proves how much easier it was to scare people back then, as one of the reasons Alfred Hitchcock filmed in Black and white was to tone down the shower scene because it was too gory.

So with that in mind, I approached this with the perspective of judging it by the era it comes from. The outcome was still impressive, and I can see why this would have been such a hit back in the day. In any case, if I hadn't been spoiled beforehand by the genre, I would probably have rated it higher. I like its originality, and I can see where some modern psychological thrillers/horrors got their influence from. I found it to be more creepy and tense rather than scary, though.

Furthermore, I thought Anthony Perkins performance as ""psycho"" Norman Bates was excellent, and he probably deserved more recognition than he got. The cinematography ironically added to the tenseness and creepiness of this film, and I didn't mind it being in Black and White as it contributed to the film. Alfred Hitchcock was ahead of his time, and you have to admire his genius. With its massive reputation and my modern outlook tainting my view of it, I found it to be slightly overrated for me, but I can truly see why it is so valued. I am so happy I have watched it and finally ticked it off the movie bucket list, and I certainly wouldn't rule out watching it again.

Look at the movie as a whole,"Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history. Hitchcock did an amazing job with that. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up. The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst.

A True Classic.,"I feel that this movie is superior to Alfred Hitchcock's other films and that it, rather than ""Vertigo"", should be considered his masterpiece. Even though it was shot on a small budget, its suspense, thanks to Hitchcock's direction, Tomasini's flawless editing, and Bernard Herrmann's still holds up on multiple viewings. Also important to the film is solid acting from Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam and John L. Russell's constantly under-rated photography.

Spellbound by Hitch,"Only a sinister organization such as the Academy would bypass Alfred Hitchcock as Best Director in 1960. Psycho is a masterpiece and Hitch will be remembered for centuries regarding his classic portrayal of a young Norman Bates, his run-down motel, and the mysterious relationship and death of his Mother. From Sam Loomis, Marion and Lila Crane, Detective Arbogast, Mr. Lowry, and even the used car salesman, Psycho is filled with astonishing characters, suspenseful plot twists, and a climax that would make every child in America think twice before entering the basement.

Alfred Hitchcock was an American icon and Psycho is a true reflection of his genius. To his day, Psycho remains one of best films of its genre. Further, Hitchcock's talent has stood the test of time, ultimately earning him the most honorable surname ""The Master of Suspense"".

Check in. Relax. Take a shower...,"PSYCHO (1960)-- Grade: A+

WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD

It's amazing how some films are kind of icons not only for a decade, but forever. If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me: what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be ""Alfred Hitchcock"", if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Buñuel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films: PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!

It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one: a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know: the decadent Bates Motel (""12 cabins, 12 vacancies""). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.

With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.

I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.

To finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got ""excited"" with them. I don't know why I'm writing that... That's interesting, but forget!

The First Modern Horror Classic,"Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed. It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by. Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic. One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving. I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me. Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie. Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding. Herrmann's score is one of his best, and there are so many memorable scenes that you just need to go watch it right now. One of Hitch's 5 best.

Alfred Hitchcock's Cult Classic !!,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" released in 1960, remains one of the most influential films in the history of cinema, setting new standards for the thriller genre with its groundbreaking techniques and psychological depth. From its iconic score to its masterfully crafted suspense, ""Psycho"" has left an indelible mark on filmmaking and storytelling.

The film introduces us to Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, who impulsively decides to steal a large sum of money and escape from her mundane life. Her journey leads her to the secluded Bates Motel, where she encounters the enigmatic and unsettling owner, Norman Bates, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. What unfolds is a captivating story filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

Hitchcock utilizes innovative filmmaking techniques that were revolutionary for its time. The stark black-and-white cinematography enhances the eerie ambiance, and the carefully composed shots create a sense of unease that permeates the film. The famous shower scene, with its rapid cuts and haunting score, is not only a pivotal moment in the narrative but also a striking example of Hitchcock's ability to manipulate viewer emotions.

The score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is another standout element of ""Psycho."" The shrieking strings evoke tension and terror, perfectly complementing the film's startling moments and enhancing its psychological impact. Herrmann's music has since become emblematic of horror cinema, signifying dread in the most minimalist yet effective manner.

The performances are outstanding, particularly Janet Leigh, whose portrayal of Marion Crane invites sympathy and connection from the audience. Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, straddling the line between charm and menace, and leaving viewers questioning his true nature.

""Psycho"" delves into themes of identity, morality, and the darker aspects of human nature, inviting a range of interpretations and discussions. It challenges characters' motivations and decisions, presenting moral dilemmas that resonate throughout the narrative, leading to a haunting exploration of the human psyche.

Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a timeless thriller that combines suspense, psychological depth, and innovative storytelling. Its influence on the horror genre and cinema as a whole cannot be overstated. Even decades after its release, ""Psycho"" continues to captivate audiences, proving that true horror often lies in the complexities of the human mind. This film is essential viewing for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking and the nature of suspense.",10/10,16 July 2024,chiragrathod19,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Greatest horror movie of all time!,"Psycho is just unbelievable! The dialogue, the camera work, the suspense, the music! Everything! Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing. Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection. He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror. Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references. Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds. Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film. I think so anyway! To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!

Best horror movie of all times??,"Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?

I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.

What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.

I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.

I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too.",6/10,7 November 2003,Pteromysvolans,Psycho (1960),NEGATIVE
"pure timeless brilliance, this is more than a classic horror film","This film will never be outdated. It's a perfect example of the art of shocking and disturbing an audience without ever having to resort to graphic violence and gore. Excellent atmosphere, superbly talented actors, and a brilliantly demented storyline -- those easily add up to an entertaining movie night no matter how many times you have watched it in the past. You know all the lines, you know the ending, but you're still pulled in from the first second to the end credits every single time. It's a rare film that accomplishes this with such a massive audience.

This film deserved better sequels and it definitely didn't deserve the terrible late 1990s remake, but the merit in this first installment actually helps all of those to hold up better than they otherwise would.

Absolutely timeless, and SO much more than just a classic! :)

"55 Years Later And ""Psycho's"" Horror Continues","Below are 2 quotes from actor Anthony Perkins who had played the pivotal role of Norman Bates in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". I think these quotes are sure to be of some interest to anyone who is at all familiar with this film and its legacy to the genre of horror.

(1) ""Hitchcock thought of Psycho (1960) as a comedy. When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny.""

(2) ""Not many people know this, but I was in New York rehearsing for a play when the shower scene was filmed in Hollywood. It is rather strange to go through life being identified with this sequence knowing that it was my double. Actually, the first time I saw Psycho and that shower scene was at the studio.""

.... Well, there you have it.",7/10,1 June 2015,xyzkozak,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"Boring,cheesy,and overated!","This has got to be one of the most overrated movies in history. What, pray-tell, is soooo scary about a man in a dress weilding a kitchen knife? No atmosphere, painfully tedious dialog, and a slow moving plot make this ""classic"" not worth seeing. how could anyone be frightned by this piece of rubbish? Not I. If you wanna be scared, go see ""The Ring"" or ""Event Horizon"", two very under-rated movies that scare while making you think. If you want to see a no brain, guy-with-a-knife slasher flick..or better yet, if you need help going to sleep, then by all means, rent ""Psycho""

First Timer,"I am starting a new journey of watching through the top 100 greatest films of all time (that I hadn't yet seen). I decided to kick start the process with ""Psycho."" I was not disappointed. Watching this for the first time, it was apparent why this film is still discussed in film classes around the world to this day. The cinematography is breathtaking and fully supports the twists, turns, and horror that has made the film so famous. I will be returning to this film again, but for the time being...10/10.

Best black and white horror ever,"I watched this movie because it was Hitchcocks anniversary and it was one of those films I'd been dying to see and I thought it was great {I didn't think it was as good as a lot of people had told me though}. The twist about mother was cool, second best in history next to the Sixth Sense. I thought 2 and 3 were cool too. Anthony Perkins was really good as Norman Bates.

"A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.",9/10,4 November 2000,Brian-272,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
The First Great Slasher,"A truly chilling and creepy film. When I saw it, it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be but it was an incredibly great film. If you haven't seen this movie and like horror flicks WATCH THIS. And even if you don't like horror that much watch this anyway. It's truly great film by the master of suspense.

Hitchcock at his scariest,"""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.

As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.

""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.

Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.

The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.

""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!",10/10,1 November 2005,jotix100,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
This is beginning to look more like what Horror should look like,"I'm not putting a spoiler because I'm talking about the shower scene, and if you don't know that scene, I'm sorry but you must not know anything. THIS is why I was so hard on Frankenstein! This is what horror should look like! It actually gets to you! We still have a ways to go, but this is definitely an improvement. That shower scene? After watching it, I realized just how easy it would be to kill someone in the shower. You're virtually deaf to everything going on outside of the shower! I realized that before, but now, my imagination can run wild with the idea of someone trying to break into my house and kill me in the shower! This is what horror and psychological thrillers are supposed to do! Mess with your head! Oh, and the camera-work and lighting were awesome too! There were some moments that were kinda unrealistic, but that's part of Hitchcock's thing. So, all in all, I really liked this movie.

One of the classics...,"""Psycho"" is a true classic, which I doubt anyone would really argue against.

It has a good story and an equally great presentation of the storyline on the screen.

The movie has a good cast to perform the various roles and characters throughout the movie. And I will say that Anthony Perkins is just amazing in the role of Norman Bates, and he alone truly made Norman Bates immortal.

""Psycho"" is adequately paced, because director Alfred Hitchcock truly was good at building up suspense and letting scenes lead up to interesting climaxes.

While ""Psycho"" is not your average slasher movie with high body counts and gore in abundance, it has the right amount of suspense and thrills to make a proper movie.

HUH. so predictable.,"considering this was in the top 250 of IMDb its hard to not watch this movie. i was expecting great things and what not. but alas it was disappointing in every way imaginable. may be it was something amazing or different in 60's but today it is just another predictable movie which wont impress today's audience. Just after the first murder i predicted its ending and not to my surprise the ending was just as predicted by me (trying not to write any spoilers) ..why its in top 30 movies is just beyond me. maybe only old people are rating these movies. and there might be a lot of them.

so yeah. its just not that thrilling or horrifying or anything it claims for today's audience. i am breaking the DVD right now.

You'll be frightened every time you use a motel shower.,"This is one of the most stunning movies my eyes have ever gazed upon. Anthony Perkins was electric in his performance as a deranged motel owner. I feel the direction was quite magnificent. I was amazed every time the camara pointed up the path to view the house on the hill where Norman Bates lived. The suspense was immense, at the beginning where Janet Leigh is about to steal the money and then sees her boss when she's leaving town to what would be a terrifying death. Movies this good are very rare and if you don't own a copy then I advise you get one as you can watch it over and over again.

Technique that defined an art,"This definitely contains **SPOILERS**, and is intended only for those who have seen the film, although it's hard to imagine many of you out there who haven't already seen this remarkable film.

Let's start with what is probably the most amazing scene in the film, the conversation between Norman and Marian in the motel office parlor. Anyone interested in learning how to develop dramatic, and/or psychological tension, should study this scene. Sharp dialog, mood swings, marvelous camera angles and great character reactions permeate the scene. Much of the scene, and it's darkly humorous lines, hint at the truth about Norman and his mother without actually revealing it. For example, as Norman is bringing the tray of food into the office for Marian after an argument with mother, he says, ""My mother is ...what's the phrase...she isn't quite herself today"". In the parlor while Marian eats, Norman defends his mother with, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"". And just before Marian leaves the office she tells Norman, ""I stepped into a private trap back there. I'd like to go back and pull myself out of it...if it's not too late"". The irony being that Marian may have decided to try to escape her trap, but she has already, unknowingly been ensnared in Norman's private trap. Yes Marian, it is too late.

In another sequence while Norman and Marian are talking in the parlor, the camera is at eye level on both characters. Suddenly, when Marian brings up the subject of Norman's mother, the camera angle changes. Norman is now being viewed from a lower angle. We are looking up at Norman and, in the background, his stuffed owl with it's wings spread, clearly in an attack posture. At the same time, we are now seeing Marian at slight downward angle. Norman has become the predator and Marian the prey!

Now, how about lighting? In a scene very near the end of the film, Marian's sister has made her way into the fruit cellar, lit by one bare bulb, where mother sits in a wheelchair. Lila touches her shoulder, the wheelchair swings around revealing mother's well preserved corpse. Lila screams and draws her hand back hitting the light bulb, causing it to swing wildly. The end result is that the remainder of the scene is played out in alternating light and shadow due to the swinging bulb: Lila's terrified face, mother's corpse, Norman running into the cellar in mother's clothes wielding a butcher's knife, Sam running in behind Norman and dragging him to the floor, Norman's face becoming a twisted mask of despair as the knife falls to the floor and the wig slips from his head. It all has the look of a nightmare...macabre, surreal, and sheer genius!

I have always loved Hitch's brand of humor, dark or otherwise. Here are some of my favorites from this film: Marian talking to Sam in the motel room at the beginning of the film, ""You make respectability sound...disrespectful"". Charlie the used car salesman, speaking to Marian, who is obviously intent on trading in her car, ""First time I ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman"". Arbogast, the private detective, speaking to Norman at the motel, ""If it doesn't gel, it isn't aspic...and this ain't gelling"". Norman speaking to Sam, after Sam has implied that Marian may have made a fool of him, ""She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother"". Lila to Sam, defending her decision to try to talk to Norman's mother, ""I can handle a sick, old woman"". How about the fact that Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and in cleaning up mother's mess he stuffs a ""Crane"" into the trunk of a car. Classic Hitch!

Let me leave you with one last tidbit. In the final scene of the film Norman is sitting in a cell, wrapped in a blanket, and we hear mother's thought that is the last line of the film, ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly"". The scene then dissolves to a shot of Marian's car being dragged from the swamp. Just as Norman's image disappears from the screen, look closely and you will see the face of mother's corpse superimposed over Norman's face for a fraction of a second. One last little (subliminal?) chill from the master! I can see you all rushing to your VCR's now. Enjoy!

"""A Psychiatrist Doesn't Lay The Groundwork ... He Merely Tries To Explain It.""","A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere. She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...

There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted. ""Psycho"" is merely a good film.

But what cleverness! The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene. Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy. Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's ""extended lunch hour"" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences. Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding. Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.

The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery. There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work. As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him. The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head. Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.

In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (""We all go a little mad sometimes""), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite. Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).

The cinematic axiom, ""Show it, don't tell it"", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom. The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.

Then something puzzling happens. The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned. Lila opines, ""I'll feel better when all this is explained,"" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down. We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition. ""Show it, don't tell it"" flies out of the window. Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly. Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen). Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing.",No rating,30 December 2000,stryker-5,Psycho (1960),NEGATIVE
Brilliant Classic!,"It's hard to think of a thriller more well known than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho! Unfortunately the films popularity may spoil the shock value. Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot. After all we haven't even met the infamous Norman Baits yet and already I am on the edge of my seat with anticipation.

We arrive at Baits Motel as the rising action rolls into the main plot. What an astounding actor Anthony Perkins is! Perfect casting for a psychopathic mamma's boy! He is an actor that truly understands his role. When he peers through the hole in the wall, spying on Marion you can almost tell the moment when the mother personality clicks on. The only thing that I could have found more satisfying would have been if we saw Norman doing his mothers voice.

I love Hitchcock's style. When Marion was stopped by the police officer the way he shot the actors close-up really gave me the impression of invaded personal space and added to my discomfort. He also had great techniques for moving the camera into may different positions without cutting. When the camera follows Norman Bates up the stairs to his mothers room the camera does a 360 as it climes and we are left with the perspective of a bug on the wall.

Psycho is a classic horror/thriller that I will watch again. It provides an outstanding cast and fantastic cinematography. The timeless score that accompanies the film could not be any better.

A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,"To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god. And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho. Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles. But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself. His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here. Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch. The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied.",10/10,29 December 1999,bamamatman,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Timeless thriller that will keep even the Generation-X'ers on the edge of their seats.,"Three years ago at the tender age of thirteen, I watched this great film, and loved it from beginning to end! Not only does it sport a fantastic cast of old character actors (Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan, Martin Balsam etc.), but the classic, instantly recognizable, scissor-like score is one of Bernard Herrmann's best since his days with CBS, composing for Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone! You must see this film, especially if your an old-film nut like me.

Cleaning Up After Mom,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.

Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.

But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.

Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them.

Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.

Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.

It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.",9/10,18 October 2006,bkoganbing,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
"Hitchcock: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy.""","I agree with the fact that it has been of (most) importance for the movie industry because of some new elements it introduced. But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them.""",6/10,2 February 2011,DzeFrenchman,Psycho (1960),NEGATIVE
One of the best movies ever made!,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**

This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!

Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!

10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!",10/10,24 October 1999,uffe-5,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
I shouldn't have been too excited,"From the past one month, I went all gaga about watching the 'classic' movie Psycho. I kept reading about it. The effect it had caused on all. My grandmother told me that it was really creepy and scary and my father warned me that I would wet my pants!

I roamed all around Vadodara, my birthplace in India but couldn't find even a single shop that sold the DVD or the VCD of the movie. Finally, God had heard my prayers. Psycho was going to be shown on the television.

I watched it with my mother and sister. My sister went all huddled in a blanket from the very beginning. Overacting, that's what she does, and I got wild at her whenever she talked loudly while the movie was going on, asking spoilers; how the movie would end? Why did she do that? Who was the mother? And what not!

And I kept waiting for something the fright the s**t out of me throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I did not find it eerie, scary, frightening at all. But I kept reminding myself that it was a movie of the 60's when there were inadequate means of adding special effects and the video cameras too would have been old and therefore not much effects could be added.

I thought the black and white color of the film would make it more frightening but unfortunately it too didn't help that much. Till the end, I kept making excuses, siding the film, about how not much facilities were available at that time.

It is a timeless classic and therefore, it is hard for me to give a rating more lower than this. But after watching movies like King Kong where the inhabitants of the Skull island were unfathomably creepy looking, the skeleton of the Mother didn't make me even shiver a bit or make my heart thump faster.

The story too was nothing too extraordinary, but an excuse I can give for this is that maybe there are a lot of movies after Psycho which have borrowed somewhat the story from the movie and therefore I found the story of Psycho a bit lame. But I feel that the story could have been better, especially the ending, because Agatha Christie too was I think, alive at that time, and the suspense in her books gave me creeps and made me perplexed. An excuse: Don't read any suspense books before seeing Psycho.

But I loved the script, though the story was a bit lame. The dialogs were crisp, especially Anthony Perkin's famous quote:- "" A boy's best friend is his mother"".

The acting was superb and all the actors were at the top notch. But no one could make my shift from my place, because I heard a lot that its a creepy film.

I would give it a seven out of ten, but still, I felt that it should have been scarier, or rather, it is my err that I was born in 1993 and watched this film in 2007, when loads of special effects enhanced the horror in films.

Any detail freaks out there? Just a few little things to add....,"I love this film, and see no need for me to add to the HUGE number of opinions already posted here about it. There are, however, a few minor things that might be of interest to some of you. Several of the comments from other folks include references to various types of instrumentation in the music, such as tubas and other brass, etc. In fact, the entire score is strings only - listen closely next time and you'll hear it!! Another great little overlooked detail is Saul Bass's main titles, converging and then flying off the screen. Okay, here's a little continuity problem that no one else I've ever talked to has noticed (possible spoiler coming): when Marion skips Phoenix with the cash, she's driving her black 1956 Ford when Mr. Lowery sees her on the street. Later, on the highway out of town, there is a point-of-view shot over the hood of the car - but the shot is of the hood of the white 1957 Ford which Marion does not acquire until later in the picture - oops!! I guess the editors figured no one would notice. By the way, that '57 Ford used to belong to Ward and June Cleaver before Marion bought it (the car was a Universal Studios property; ""Leave It To Beaver"" was filmed on the same lot as ""Psycho""). Anyway, enjoy the film (p.s. you do know that the blood in the shower scene is really chocolate syrup, don't you?)

10/10,"This movie is a classic for a reason. The lack of special effects, CGI and stuff used in movies now does not stop 'Psycho' from sending a chill down the spine. Unlike movies like 'The Exorcist' that relies on swearing, disfigured face and the infamous pea-soup vomit (which, by the way, makes the movie much less scary when watched today, but it is understandable why it was such a classic horror flick in its day) to produce its scares, 'Psycho' relies on its actors and their performance - which is why it still holds up today. There isn't a single boring or unwanted scene, and the plot is fast-paced enough to hold our attention, and at the same time, not overwhelmingly so. This is a movie that still remains a classic even though sixty-odd years have passed since its release. It deserves at least one watch and won't be boring even if you re-watch it.

Masterpiece of Horror,"Its one of those movies that is by far one of the best of all times. The story is exceptional. The acting is wonderful. The sick and craziness of the theory of Norman Bates is awesome. It takes the genre of Horror and Suspense to whole different level. Perkins made Norman more than a character. Hitchcock delivered a Masterpiece that many would try compare to, but can't.

After 38 years it still delivers the goods.,"Alfred Hitchcock is still my favorite director and with Psycho he proved that a great director can make a great film for less than one million dollars. The shower scene could be the greatest scene ever put down on film. Everyone puts in 100%. From Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's chilling all string score Psycho can never be remade.

Awesome work of art!,"Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.

The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.

The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.

If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie. Although the movie really is wonderful, it's not quite worth dying for. Really.",10/10,5 November 2005,papjimbob,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
The most brilliant movie I've ever seen!!,"I just saw Psycho for the first time about 3 weeks ago....and I'm still in awe. Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest film-maker of all time. Every shot in that movie, couldn't have been done better. I was amazed that I hadn't heard about the movie...well, what happens in it, in all my 20 years :) And I'm so glad that I never heard anything....cause it was so fun to watch :) Anthony Perkins, IS Norman Bates. No one could have picked a better man for the role. He's just so darn cute :) It is a WONDERFUL movie...and beautifully done. Hitchcock is a master in his trade :)

Masterpiece,"A masterpiece. The ultimate thriller, and the movie that created the template for slasher-horror movies.

Solid plot, but the genius behind this is Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down.

Hitchcock is aided by some excellent performances. Anthony Perkins is calculating menace personified as Norman Bates. Janet Leigh shines and deserved her Oscar nomination.

Truly a classic, and one of the greatest movies of all time.

Watch more films!,"anyone who calls this the ""greatest film of all time"" needs to watch more films, especially films from other countries around the world.

Psycho does a few tricks on its audience but other than that, it has nothing much to qualify it as a ""great film.""

technically, it's also nothing great. if you're looking for good technique in a Hitchcock film, you're better off watching The Birds.

psychologically, it's also nothing impressive. sure its main reference is Freud's Oedipus Complex, but many films before it has already explored that, albeit in different ways.

sure, it's surprising that the first protagonist dies halfway through the film.

and sure, the twist at the end is awesome.

but ""the greatest film of all time""?

you need to get out more often.

An unforgettable masterpiece,"Marion Crane works for an estate agent in Phoenix; one Friday afternoon a client pays $40,000 in cash for a property and her boss ask to take it for the bank as he doesn't want it in the office over the weekend. Rather than going to the bank she sets off to California. It is a long journey and after spending one night in her car, after she is woken by a suspicious police officer she buys a new car. Then, as it starts to rain, she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper. She hears his mother expressing her disapproval of him being alone with a young woman before she has her supper in the office. The then returns to her room and prepares for bed. Now things get creepy; Norman takes a picture off the wall and uses a spy hole to observe Marion as she gets undressed. Then as she takes a shower somebody enters her room and brutally murders her. Soon people are starting to wonder what happened to her and the $40,000. Her boss has sent a private detective to find her and her sister goes to see her boyfriend, who has no idea where she is. The detective checks a string of motels before finding that she stayed at the Bates motel. As the story progresses we learn more about Norman and his mother all leading to one of cinema's most shocking conclusions.

This film is rightly considered a classic; I would love to have watched it without knowing about what happened. For the first half of the film follows Marion Crane, setting her up as the protagonist; everybody else we see, including Norman Bates, appears to be very much secondary characters so anybody lucky enough not to know the film's first famous twist should be genuinely surprised. Until her death it looks as though the film would centre on whether she would be caught or whether she would see the error of her ways and return the money. After the infamous 'shower scene' the tone changes dramatically as we learn just what is going on at the Bates Motel and ultimately discover Norman's shocking secret. Janet Leigh does a fine job as the good girl who has made a bad choice but it is Anthony Perkins who stands out with his nuanced performance as Norman Bates; at times charming at others chilling. Hitchcock's direction is superb; he manages to show brutal murder without actually showing and of the actual brutality; just a raised knife, Marion screaming and blood going down the plug hole blood that isn't even red as the film is black and white. Obviously this isn't suitable for younger viewers but I'd say it is a must see for all older film fans.

"Exasperatingly detailed, steely-cold precursor to the 'slasher'...","Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****

Unexpectedly dull movie for the modern times,"Granted, this movie might be of a lot of artistic value, with all the cinematography amongst other things, and also it might have scared a lot of people in the older generations. But I don't see any reason why this movie should be rated 1st amongst the Horror movie genre top 10 in contemporary times. Imagine an average Joe who wants to spend his precious weekend day watching a good horror flick with his girlfriend to get to cosying up. He would expect the no. 1 in horror genres on IMDb to be pretty scary to say the least.

Not only did this movie failed to ""horrify"" the both of us, we did not find this much of an entertaining thriller as well(as it is just that--a thriller). Not sure why it's listed in the horror category. Do not recommend this movie if your situation is similar to what I described above. Maybe if you're a movie enthusiast who loves the cinematographic detail, go ahead...

Nobody Does It Better Than Hitchcock,"Throughout his long and illustrious career, director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere, but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller, `Psycho,' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates. And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing. Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life: Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return. Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore. The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel. Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis. Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.' But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy. His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect. And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. The supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman). If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense. There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock. I rate this one 10/10.

My favorite film!!!,"Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose. No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be). In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960. It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.

This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion. Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples. Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit. Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art. No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films. There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here. Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.

The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score. There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie. One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about. It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film. Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today. Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960! I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score. Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession. His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.

Just watch this film. If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience. If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best! If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail.",10/10,2 March 2001,reedmilder,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Hitchcock: True Cinematic Genius(spoilers),"My mother always used to complain about this movie, it being the one suspense/horror film she actually went to. The shower scene tormented her dreams for a long period of time. I am very glad that she never actually gave me the details of the movie, as I was able to enjoy it without anything spoiled. From the point of the unknowing 90's viewer, this movie still holds up superbly, and becomes even more amazing if enough Hitchcock documentaries are watched. I find a couple of things are overlooked though. The greatest scene in my opinion is not the shower scene(although having the billed star die halfway through the film is incredible). It is the conversation between in the hotel room with the stuffed birds in the background. Subtle with so many distinct ironies and fantastic underplayed acting, mixed with the eerieness of that background creates maybe my second favorite scene in film(the first being the ending stairwell scene from Vertigo) Perhaps what creeped me out the most was the visual of that lonely forgotten house atop the hill, definitely embued with some unknown prescence that the audience cannot quite put their finger on. Like all stellar pieces of film or theater, there is a great deal of humor despite the premise of the work. The most amazing part of this film is its implication on cinema as a whole - the disturbing material inspired countless psychological thrillers and changed film forever. Although none will be able to match this movie for the sake of pure cinematic beauty, that's where the genius of Hitchcock comes into play. He is probably the single greatest director of our time(sorry Kubrick), despite many nowadays not being able to enjoy what they consider ""dated"" films. *Sigh*

"Great performances, direction, score, a worthy classic","I watched this one last night for a third time. As always with Hitchcock's movies, this one looks better with every time. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The direction is amazing (and very much ahead of its time), Bernard Herman's score is possibly the best piece of music written for a motion picture, a true work of art(and it's a pity there is not a soundtrack album out) and of course Perkins' performance is totally out of this world. And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking his mother's thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it. A true masterpiece.

"Very original, very clever, very good.","I just saw it in film studies class at university and i love it. Honestly, it really is a masterpiece. The direction is extremely original and credible and the adapted script is one of the most interesting, in that the main character within the movie fluctuates. I think this is a very interesting and clever idea which makes ""the shower scene"" more shocking. The music is also infinitely effective in creating atmosphere within the film. If you haven't seen this movie try not to find out too much about it - although I guess it's inevitable because it's a genuine classic. No matter what, you should enjoy it if you appreciate it for what it is.

A mind is a terrible thing to lose,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real.",10/10,22 October 1998,witch king,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Anthony Perkins,"WOW. I'd heard a lot (like all of us, probably) about this movie but I hadn't actually watched until last night.

Anthony Perkins' performance was so good!

His face transformed so many times.

He looks both like a nice boy and a scary one. His nervous ticks and air of sweetness and menace! *clapping*.

The fact that Perkins could never escape this role proves that he played the part perhaps too well.

And that ending, I wasn't expecting that! Marvellous.

This is one to watch again and again.,"Alfred Hitchcock's crisp efficiency is not unlike that of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the dutiful son who cleans up after his mother in the landmark thriller ""Psycho."" Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured. The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits. Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great). Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters. It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me.",9/10,4 March 2001,salatiello,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE
Art History,"Story: The story is captivating. A great thriller about a young man who suffers from mental disorders. It has its lengths, especially in the beginning, but when it comes to the motel part, things are starting to evolve and the pace picks up. 7/10

Actors: They all do an amazing job, but the one who carries to whole movie is Anthony Perkins - his acting skills are phenomenal. The fact that it was released in 1960 makes this even more outstanding. 9/10

Setting: Even after watching Psycho so many times, the house and motel scenery still gives me the goosebumps. 10/10

Picture: Not bad for its age, but have seen some better restorement. 5/10

Sound: The sound quality was disasterous. Voices were extremely quiet, as if the actors were mumbling, while the music was way too loud and shrill. 2/10

Score: Just one word, amazing! 10/10

Average: 7,1/10 The movie is an outstanding piece of art history. Compared to today's standard, it has lost a bit of its shine. Nonetheless, if you haven't watched it yet, do it, you won't regret it.

The Perkins Factor,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",10/10,27 July 2009,mark-lovellsamuels,Psycho (1960),POSITIVE

Like the film? Read the book.,"I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",9/10,20 November 2017,paskuniag-584-890551,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Even after years of being made.. it is good!,"I wish people made more movies like this nowadays..

Yes! The movie is LONG, but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her, to agreeing with her, to.. all sort of emotions!! It is well worth anyone's time. These characters feel SO real! It's like a perfect summarized soap opera. Anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book. Would recommend to anyone.

And make yourself a favor and don't watch the sequel.. the movie ends the way it does for a reason.

An immortal and towering achievement,"It is always in people's nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic: in story, in special effects, in casting (with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as ""Ashley"") and in captivation. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish, spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than life.

Leaving Vivien's astounding performance aside, this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic. Watch it. Esther's rating: 20/10

Miracle in Film Making - Can't believe they did it in 1939!,"This movie was on my watch list since 1996 or 1997 when I read its review in a local newspaper. I though it must be a dull movie as it is very old and procrastinated to watch until Dec 2019.

And friends, I can't tell you how much I am impressed with this movie - wonderful story, superb acting, mesmerizing cinematography and direction. And they did it in 1939 - which is really hard to digest.

I am stupid enough to miss this glory for so many years.

The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review,"At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background... Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell...",10/10,12 June 2020,Turanic,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood,"I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.",10/10,5 August 2006,planktonrules,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Georgia on my mind,"This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.

The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.

""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.

One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.

The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.

The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.

The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.

Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.

Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.",10/10,22 February 2005,jotix100,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious,"Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.

Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.

It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently.

If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.

It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection.

I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.

Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.

I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie.

It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.

And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.

Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.

Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.

David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.

Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.

And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.

"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.

Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.

Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.

Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.

The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite.

The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.

PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10

"A few flaws, but undeniably a massive achievement in film","One of the greatest achievements in film history. This is not only an eye-popping cinematic treat, but one of the greatest stories ever put on celluloid. The movie lasts nearly four hours--- it's longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made. But the time goes by so quickly that you'll miss it when it's over.

Of course, we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the 1860s. It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a plantation owner's daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times. She's willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it. When the movie opens, the country is on the verge of civil war--- North against South--- but Scarlett barely notices, and doesn't care in the least. Her biggest obsession is that she's in love with dreamy/poetic Ashley Wilkes, and she stays in love with him throughout 98 percent of the movie.

The only problem is....Ashley doesn't have any particular interest in her at all. In fact, he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton--- a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end. Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtain.

She would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler, a much more solid, rather dangerous man with a reputation as a no-good scoundrel. He is openly attracted to Scarlett, grows to love her (although he dare not let her know, or she'll use it against him), and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie, he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then, ironically--- and they never really are happy together.

The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one, the colorful supporting roles for another.

A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish, one-dimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex, multi-dimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes, she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless: the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family, and Melanie (keeping in mind that, other than her father, she doesn't even particularly like any of them) are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done, and she's fiercely courageous.

Despite her hardness, she does also grow as a person. To her great credit, she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie, she does finally realize how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there.

Some quick high points, and a few flaws: the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard, and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular--- wise, funny, respected Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and wistful, decent-at-heart prostitute Belle Watling (Ona Munson) are standouts.

The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droppingly beautiful.

Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-lifes as ""poor white trash"", and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.

A few minor flaws, and I do mean minor: 1) Most of the acting looks pretty modern, but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little old-style. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's ""method"" acting in the 1930s. 2) Some of the ""raw"" scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks, she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It *was* big-time Hollywood after all. 3) The second half of the movie is more ""talky"" and less action-oriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring, just less movement. I don't find it draggy, but some people do.

Still a heck of a good story, and a great film, so enjoy the ride!

A Timeless Movie About Love and Being Strong,"""Gone with the Wind"" is a well-known film that takes us back to the time of the Civil War and what happened afterward in the American South. It's based on a book written by Margaret Mitchell in 1936 and was turned into a movie directed by Victor Fleming. The movie is all about love, being strong, and dealing with tough times during a war. Many people have loved this movie for a long time, and it's considered an important part of the history of movies.

The main character in the movie is Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh. Scarlett is a determined Southern woman who has to deal with all the troubles of the Civil War and what came after. She's strong-willed, but she can also be ruthless when it comes to protecting her family's plantation, Tara. In the movie, she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable. Rhett is charming, but he can also be cynical. The movie shows how their relationship changes as the story goes on.

This movie is famous for its big and impressive scenes, especially in the beginning. It shows the grandeur of Southern plantations and the beauty of the South. The movie's look was groundbreaking for its time because it used a color technology called Technicolor, which made everything look even more vivid. One of the most famous scenes in the history of movies is when Atlanta is burning. This scene shows how much effort went into making this movie.

A major theme in ""Gone with the Wind"" is about change. Scarlett's character starts as a self-centered and materialistic young woman but changes as she faces the challenges of the Civil War. She becomes a survivor who can handle anything. Her character represents how the South changed because of the war. This theme meant a lot when the movie was released during the Great Depression, and it still means something to people today.

The movie also looks at love in different ways. Scarlett has unrequited love for a man named Ashley Wilkes, and she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler. These relationships show that love can be really complicated. Rhett's famous line, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" is one of the most famous lines in movies. It shows how his relationship with Scarlett changes.

""Gone with the Wind"" is also famous for how it shows the American South. It shows the beauty of the South, but it also doesn't hide the terrible parts of the Civil War. However, the movie has been criticized for not showing the history of slavery in the South accurately. It's also criticized for how it shows Black characters, which was a reflection of the time when the movie was made.

Even though ""Gone with the Wind"" is loved by many, it's also important to remember that it has problems when it comes to how it shows race and the South. But even with these issues, it's a movie that people still enjoy and talk about.

Astounding Film - GWTW is the Definition of a Classic!,"The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.

Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?

GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).

GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.

The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.

The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. . ""After all, tomorrow is another day."" 10/10",10/10,15 November 2003,Alexis_Ray,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"A classic of respectable scope, well ahead of its time","So, I've been calling myself a movie buff for ages, but it took me to get to the tender age of 23 to see one of the greatest classics in the history of cinema. I must say I was pretty impressed. The film has some outdated touches of the theatrical and romantic, but much less so than I expected. It's also interesting how the main character of Scarlett O'Hara- nicely portrayed by Leigh- is so very unsympathetic, almost an anti-hero. Still, Scarlet is a strong and interesting character who gains depth throughout the film. She goes from being a detestable manifestation of a privileged, unproductive lifestyle to an independent, even cruel persona full of determination and courage.

This one was at its best when depicting the cruelty of the American civil war, when the focus of the story was less on relationships and more on the agelessly political.

The Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time,"The film claims in the opening credits to have a historian as a consultant, Wilbur G. Kurtz. And, at the time of its making, what he did sufficed as history.

The Old South was claimed to be a ""pretty world,"" ""a dream remembered,"" and full of gallantry. There are innumerable problems with the film the greatest of which is racist sentiment.

The portrayal of ""Mammy"" is particularly racist. Manny has no name and her entire life is invested in Scarlett's. She says the happiest day of her life is when Scarlett has her child. She is always worried about the family's reputation and lives vicariously through them. She becomes terribly upset and emotional when Rhett and Scarlett fight. Most outrageously, Mammy is seen pushing USCT soldiers aside to allow Scarlett through as if Mammy and other former slaves have no interest in their own freedom.

If the portrayal of Mammy is bad, the portrayal of Prissy is even worse. Mammy is at least portrayed has having some sense whereas Prissy plays ""the simple-minded darkie"" with no courage at all. Her high pitched voice serves to emphasize her inanity.

Mammy and Prissy's characters are part of a larger lie that the movie attempts to tell: the myth of the ""loyal darkies."" In the scene where Atlanta is under attack by Sherman, some black men say, ""Don't worry! We'll stop them Yankees!"" When one slave is given a watch he refuses to accept it and insists that Scarlett should keep it as if to say, ""Look! These white people were so great to us we want nothing from them!"" The film also advances the myth of benign slavery. Scarlett's father tells her to treat slaves gently, as if the only problem is a few bad masters who commit excesses. When Ashley complains of misgivings about white prison labor, he says that he kept all of his slaves well-fed and would have freed them when his father died if the war had not done so first.

Finally, the film advances the myth of the evil carpetbagger. ""Carpetbaggers"" are shown to be terrible and vicious people who kick injured Confederates off the road and ride with nicely dressed black men sitting in a position of equality. One night, the white southerners ""clean out the woods to protect their women,"" which is just code for organizing the KKK and committing murder.

The film is rife with faux sentiment, posturing, and social strategizing. Scarlett O'Hara is simply a terrible character. She is screaming, crying and whining. She's weak, flirtatious, boy-crazy, and hopelessly in love. She slaps Prissy and tells her she will sell her south. Scarlett is manipulative, lying, deceptive, lovesick, and obsessed with looks. And all her tribulations are emphasized by melodramatic music and foreboding weather.

Even scenes which would otherwise be wonderful must be condemned because of the vicious intent behind them. The contrast of the tree, Scarlett, and her father against the setting sun is simply perfect. But, it intends to advance the myth of the idyllic Old South. After the attack on Atlanta, the camera shows the land covered with soldiers and pans back up to the Confederate flag. While expertly shot, the scene is used to evoke sympathy for the Lost Cause.

This film competes with Birth of a Nation for the title of ""Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time."" Gone with the Wind is less racist, but much more celebrated than Birth of a Nation. Given the two criteria, it is difficult to say which is worse. Birth of a Nation has been kicked off AFI's Top 100 Films while Gone with the Wind still sits perched at #4. Whereas films like Christmas with the Kranks are unequivocally awful, Gone with the Wind is worse. The reason being that it is much worse to be shitty and pernicious than it is to be shitty and harmless.

To paraphrase a quote from Scarlett, ""As God is my witness, I will never watch this film again!""",1/10,30 November 2007,Nitestik,Gone with the Wind (1939),NEGATIVE
"The Greatest Film of its Time, and All Time","I believe that when one views a film, one should consider the context in which it was made.

Barely 10 years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first full-length color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced, and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest pot-boiler blockbuster novel into a movie.

And what a movie. Stunning color, the most popular mail actor of his time, perfect music score, incredible action scenes, story line only 70 years removed from when it happened, and on, and on. Can you imagine what a store-clerk or a farmer, or a teacher experienced in that world, seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with? 1939 was a watershed year for great movies, and this one was the greatest produced. Try watching this movie as if there were no TV, no DVD's, only a few radio stations, spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned, never having seen such a movie before, and you get what I mean. Masterful for its time, and still timeless today.",10/10,27 September 2006,dhable,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
There's never going to be a movie like this,"It was way back on New Year's day of 2014 when I got myself a copy of this movie and watched it for the first time, in total awe; that one hadn't got an overture, intermission and exit music and ran at about 3,5 hours but I didn't feel the time at all. What's 4 hours of time when the story is timeless?

What can I tell you about the movie that you don't already know? That it is the highest grossing movie of all times? That it got eight Oscars including the first ever given to an African-American, Hattie McDaniel (whose Mammy was an adorable character and I'm totally in love with her performance)? Or that I love this movie to the moon and back? Yes, that's what I'm going to say.

This 1939's masterpiece is a perfection of a movie and frankly my dears I don't give a damn about what you have to say about it. Excellent performances (especially by Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel) and lovable characters, impressive war and hospital scenes, plot and storylines that leave you fidgeting on the edge of the seat until the end, beautiful music, astounding cinematography, colorful set pieces, splendid direction by Victor Fleming and the list goes on and on. It's easier to say bad things about the movie because there are none.

Sometimes we all feel like Scarlett: that we are living a lie, believing the things that are untrue, making other people miserable and thinking there's no one out there who truly loves us the way we are but missing it all because of the blindfold on our eyes. But once we take it off everything changes. You change. I change. And I hope every new day will bring positive changes for all of us because after all tomorrow is another day...",10/10,28 April 2022,jamesjustice-92,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
A Classic in the History of Movie-making.,"Every time I watch this film, and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.

"Margaret Mitchell won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel on May 3rd, 1937","The year 1939 was a busy year for the Hollywood industry. Large-scale, majestic epics were front and center that year. You should look up the list of films released in 1939. It was a very, busy year, with huge titles from the golden age. Lots and lots of entertainment for a pre-WW2 audience. The Wizard of Oz (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and this little film, are just some of the titles on that list. Everyone was competing for perfection in the film industry. The first two hurtles, being sound and color film, had been implemented into the technical side of the filmmaking process, to this point in film history. Technicolor had been utilized for, about, five years to this point and it was perfectly utilized in this film too. Technicolor always was a good film stock, rich with colors, that pop on the screen. Head cinematographer, Ernest Haller's camera, captures images, not seen before on film and blazes colors across the screen, in Gone With the Wind (1939).

I'm sure everyone knows the basic premise of the film. It boils down to a story about the life of woman, a daughter of a rich cotton plantation owner in 1860s, Georgia, who's life interweaves with the real life events of the American Civil War and the recovery and reconstruction years. It is a fictitious story utilizing events from the real world. Of course, most of us remember the picture on the movie posters of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), locked in that emotional, romantic embrace, plus it's on the cover of every DVD and Blu-Ray out there these days, but the film is really about Scarlett and all the other characters come into her circle. And, the film needs to be about Scarlett in order to be successful, because it is her spoiled, selfish, smug demeanor that energizes the whole film. Everyone who comes into her circle feels her wrath, even Rhett. Rhett isn't really a very likeable character either and watching these two unlikeable characters square off, through various parts of this film, is something to see. These are the reasons, that make this film so good. A plot involving two unlikeable characters, who eventually, reach a certain amount of maturity, that they earn some respect from the audience, doesn't deter from the overall quality of the film, because it is such a unique character study, while chaos is happening all around them.

The film does contain many sub-plots, involving politically, socially, culturally and racially charged tones, which would be expected, considering the time this period piece takes place. Which, brings up another interesting point to this film. Even though this film is approaching 85 years old now in the 21st century, it is still considered a period piece. The interesting part is the filmmakers had a more recent memory of the events used in the film, being only 75 years before, as opposed to our view, which is roughly 150 years later. In fact, there probably were a couple of Civil War veterans still alive in 1939. Another amazing thing about this film is, they started shooting this thing in January, 1939 and released it just before Christmas that same year. That is impressive, considering the massive runtime of this film. It is the runtime of this film that really hurts it from being a perfect film.

The images the filmmakers (I would list names, but you should see the Crew List on this film), are able to show us on the screen, is incredible. The color you will have stuck in your head, for a week after viewing this film, will be the color of orange, red fire, that is seen throughout the movie and obviously, mostly comes from the burning of Atlanta. A technical achievement, that hadn't been seen in the movies yet. The special effects, art direction, costuming and lighting is fantastic. You still don't notice, even today, that most of this movie was just filmed, out in the Los Angeles countryside and on sound stages. So much is going on in this film, you don't notice it. The performances by the cast is perfect. This is an epic journey about redemption and maturing. A maturity that helps the characters and a nation begin to grow. This film would roll through the Oscars in 1940, including winning the Best Picture Oscar.

A rich romantic film...,"Gerard O'Hara (Thomas Mitchell), an Irish immigrant, settles in North Georgia and becomes a prosperous plantation owner By great luck he marries young Ellen Robillard (Barbara O'Neill) of Savannah, the daughter of one of the noblest Georgian families and becomes accepted by his aristocratic neighbors They are blessed with three daughters, Scarlett (Vivien Leigh), Suellen (Evelyn Keyes), and Carreen (Ann Rutherford).

Scarlett, the eldest, worships her mother Yet, under her beauty and Southern coquetry, she is charming, but proud, willful and vain She believes she is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a good-hearted young army captain But Ashley loves his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland), a delicate, selfless woman He is frightened by Scarlett's energy and animation And although he admits his feelings for her, he is afraid to marry her and decides to take Melanie for his bride

When Scarlett loses Ashley she is more certain than ever that she must have him On their wedding day, she meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a wealthy adventurer from an old Charleston family Rhett, a gamblerwho believes that self-interest is the motive of all human conductis attracted by Scarlett's beauty and realizes that they are equally merciless and conscienceless

Vivien Leigh is magnificent as the spoiled, selfish southern belle... She carries the picture, and controls it... She reproduces the spirited character of Scarlett in all its fluent complexity...

Clark Gablewith a smile and great light in his eyesis fascinating as the elegant, heroic gentleman ... He is perfect as the ladies man... His dramatic high point is his scene crying in Melanie's presence... His love scenes with Scarlett give the picture a vibrancy that is one of its great attractions... The film begins with their first stormy meeting in the library at Twelve Oaks and intensifies at the Atlanta bazaar, when he shocks the confederacy by bidding $l00 ""in gold,"" to dance with the newly widowed Mrs. Hamilton who cares for nothing but herself

Hattie McDaniel gives a rich characterization as Mammy, Scarlett's shrewd black servant who was never fooled by Scarlett's airs and tears...

A Tempestuous Hurricane of a Tornado...,"When a film is consistently recognised through the wisdom of the crowd, over so many years, as being great and epic and, for the duration of that film to run close to four hours - it really does suggest something a bit special. That something a bit special is a timeless story set during some of the darkest times in American history but it isn't the setting that makes this special, it's the story, the story of a cruel, selfish and manipulative opportunist performing her craft to perfection, it's the story portrayed through one of the greatest cinematic performances the world of movies has ever seen. While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh. Setting the bar so high it remains unparalleled, even to this day.

Antebellum Classic,"Gone With the Wind is a classic antebellum masterpiece, addressing the turmoil of the conflict of the Civil War through the eyes of a manipulative southern belle. Despite the destruction wrought by the Yankee invasion into Georgia, Scarlett O'Hara is resilient in her determination to restore the Tara plantation to its former glory. ""Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts."" Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara instills in her the southern ideal of property and station. Throughout the movie, Scarlett draws on Tara and ""home"" for strength. Despite some historical inaccuracies, the feel of the Old South is clearly present in this timeless classic of love and war.

Not all that in my opinion ...,"I'm sorry, I generally don't like this film. Expansive, epic, picturesque, an achievement for its time ... OK. A compelling story about the devastation, hardship, suffering and brutality of the Civil War, and the courage and resilience of its survivors ... OK, but credit the novel for all that.

A key problem is the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara, who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie. Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot. Another problem is that the film drags in many places. Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley. Gosh, move on with it!

Even for its time, I can't see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur.

A universal masterpiece and one of the few privileged films where every scene is a classic on its own ...,"For some nostalgic dreamers, ""Gone With the Wind"" is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War, and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order, a Civilization forever ""gone with the wind"". It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.

But for some idealistic spirits, ""Gone With the Wind"" resonates as one of the most heart-breaking pages of American History, when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty, Freedom and Justice, and when History, written by the victorious side, ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. ""Gone With the Wind"" chronicles what the South used to be, a world where coexisted two cultures, the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simple-minded Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) who knew nothing about ""birthin' babies"" and the wisdom and authority of Mammy, Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning role: two figures, two extremes, so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them, despite the obvious stereotypes.

For literate minds, History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling, inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life, where the passing of time can be felt, when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic, sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), married to the gentle and extremely good-hearted cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable anti-heroine: selfish, greedy, jealous, but so brave, courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity, a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic ""As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again"".

The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters: she doesn't care for etiquette, for traditions, her spirit is free, her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past, Scarlett thinks of the future, as she says: ""after all, tomorrow is another day"". Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler, Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston', is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era, they think of money, greed, prosperity, and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for, transcending the old-fashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War, the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.

For many passionate hearts, this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen, a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strong-minded egos, two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley, the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude, probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War, too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth, a lost but so endearing cause, a fire that burnt inside, and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky, during Atlanta's big fire.

Love has never been as passionate as a love-and-hate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause, mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett, lost in her love for Ashley, will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does, Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable come-uppance ever: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life, and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This ""I don't give a damn"" voted #1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge, and he sure deserved it... and many wannabe-Scarlett would admit that too.

But while ""Gone With the Wind"" deals with lost causes, it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best- seller, it's one of the greatest films of all time, the greatest casting ever, the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's super-production that would become a landmark in film-making, with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors, forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree, during a beautiful sunset. Along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Gone With the Wind"" is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .

All-time classic,"I was put off watching this for a long time, mainly because I mistakenly believed it to be an old-fashioned romance. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, it's a story of how two maladjusted characters come together and the volatile relationship that progresses.

That's the central thrust of the tale, but there's a whole lot more to GONE WITH THE WIND than that. It's an epic reconstruction of a by-gone era, a pre-Civil War American South in which man and slave lived side by side. It's a war story featuring some hugely impressive pyrotechnic effects which must have blown cinema-goers away on first release. And it's an exploration of the darkest reaches of the human condition.

The actors are fantastic. Vivian Leigh really makes something of what must have been a difficult role to play. It's especially noticeable with Olivia de Havilland starring in the traditional role of the beautiful, warm-hearted heroine, and then seeing Leigh's haunted, bitter and vengeful character appearing opposite her in contrast. I especially liked Clark Gable, who exudes charisma from every pore.

The production values are immaculate, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong, and the ultra-lengthy running time flies past thanks to the viewer's involvement in the events that unfold. Tragic, shocking, moving and heart-warming in equal measure, GONE WITH THE WIND truly is a film for the ages.",9/10,1 February 2013,Leofwine_draca,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"A sweeping epic film, that in my eyes is outstanding!","Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer. This film was ignored for a long time, and is now considered one of the most remarkable films ever made. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10/10,12 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
My absolute favorite movie. Nothing can hold a candle to this masterpiece.,"Gone With the Wind is without a doubt, one of the most magnificent romances ever. A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves it's viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel. A book was written in the 90s that continued the story but trust me, it sucked. Scarlett was such a complex character, selfish, spirited, passionate about everything she wants. But in the end you see that Scarlett changes, she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did. Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isn't a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you won't SEE the complexity. Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star, I pity you. You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didn't see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history. Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes. It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration (plus the effort it took) when you give this movie a one/ten. It deserves so much more.

One of the Greatest,"A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable. Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity.

A world is going down, a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone - melancholy, fear, the sacrifice, and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War.

In our troubled times, where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and faster-going constant stream and faster-going flow, where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us, a movie more relevant than most people think.

"Fact, Fiction, Feminism, and The Elephant in the Room","""Gone With the Wind"" represents a vision of The Old South through the romanticism from which great stories are born. Nearly 75 years after its initial release, the movie is still loved and beloved, offering a portrait of a stubborn woman's sexual adventures backed up by a war whose sad legacy remains with us even today.

From the outset, it might seem to just a simple romantic adventure about a stubborn woman's attempts to find her own measure of sexual freedom, but there is something deeper. The backdrop of ""Gone With the Wind"" is a war that completely restructured the American landscape and created social legacies that we, in the 21st century are still dealing with. At its center is a character who reveals the nature of being able adapt to the enormous changes that would follow.

Scarlett O'Hara represents the future. When the war ended, the rigid tradition of The Old South would die away as the southern economy and traditions were essentially destroyed. Scarlett won't be pinned down by that tradition. She is stubborn, independent, man-hungry and pursues a man, Ashley Wilkes, for no other reason than that he is promised to someone else. She marries to keep from being an old maid, and then pursues one man while resisting another. She sees what she wants and takes it; she is keen but not perceptive. If she were then she might have seen that Rhett Butler is almost her exact equal. He is no gentlemen, visiting Miss Whattling's house of ill-repute and openly admitting that he runs blockade for profit. They are perfect for one another and we know that their attitudes will become the social norm, set in place in the years after the Civil War.

What is unexpected is the way Scarlett casts off the role of southern lady and begins toiling in the dirt to save the family plantation. Her sisters complain about callused hands and sore backs but compare Scarlett with the other women in the movie, you will see the she will survive once the war has ended because she has learned how to face it head on. She has learned how to scheme and manipulate. She grows When we first meet her, she's sitting on the porch at Tara, her face bright and cheery in the Georgia sun surrounded by a flock of potential suitors. This would be the position she would seek to find again in life, the option of having her pick of the man she wants even when he belongs to someone else. Scarlett provides the narrative and the entire business of the war is seen through her eyes. There are no battles. The reality arrives when wounded soldiers are flooded into town in such vast numbers that the streets are lined with wounded and the dead.

That point of view allows us to see Scarlett grow from winsome southern belle, to frustrated widow, to a woman who rises from the ashes of the war, determined to never be hungry again. After that lies her transformation to revolutionary as she determines to return Tara to its former glory. By the time she arrives back to Tara to find it plundered by Yankees, we know that Scarlett won't give up.

That ""Gone With the Wind"" allows such a feminist story is impressive. Yet, the movie avoids the elephant in the room. It deals with slavery simply by not dealing with slavery. The struggle to free the slaves remains at the edges of the film. In that, the movie is a product of its time. The book had been part of a long series of literary works known as ""Anti-Tom Literature"", books that came after ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" that attempted to downplay the reality of slavery by focusing on the good-hearted white slave owners while portraying slaves as docile and apparently happy. In Mitchell's book Scarlett regards the slaves in internal monologue, ""There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy."" The issue of slavery has always been so touchy. Note that most films about The Civil War take place from the point of view of The Union. ""Gone With the Wind"" follows the Anti-Tom ideal by dealing with the slaves only very briefly. Male slaves are seen briefly while two female house servants, Mammy and Prissy, supply key supporting roles – again holding up the film's feminist slant. Mammy is a mother figure; always the conscience over Scarlett's shoulder as she propels herself forward into wreckless sexual adventures. Prissy, the younger house servant, portrays a somewhat comic role.

The movie avoids controversy. Margaret Mitchell's book had a subplot involving the KKK, but in adapting the film, producer David O. Selznick omitted that element. He wanted to avoid the same controversy that unpinned ""The Birth of a Nation"" 24 years earlier.

Perhaps dealing with the issue in the cold light of day might have unpinned the story's romantic fire. This is a story about a Southern woman's full-force sexual adventures. Slavery doesn't seem to be a part of this story, only the provocation of the war that surrounds it. We are asked to admire ""Gone With the Wind"" for how it portrays women while at the same time forgiving it for how it avoids the larger issue of slavery as a means of still providing escapist entertainment. That's a lot of weight to carry, especially in our politically correct culture. ""Gone With the Wind"" focuses on ideas and attitudes that were prevalent in the 1930s. It is a time stamp, a window into the attitudes of a time gone by. The Civil War is not presented here, only an interpretation of the way we all heard about it, so maybe we can look on this movie as a manner of how the devastation of this war came to be so romanticized. In that way, the movie is invaluable.

Clark Gable was a great actor,"This movie is a bit too melodramatic for me. I don't usually watch romance movies.

However, I have to admit the cinematography is pretty nice. There are some really good images. The high points for me were the civil war scenes and especially Clark Gable's acting. He is really good, I love his sarcasm. His character was really really charismatic. Imagine RDJ's Tony Stark, dialed up to eleven. The main actress was also pretty good. There is some interesting character development.

All in all, I think it deserves a watch.

Gone with the Wind,"Scarlett (O'Hara) Hamilton: ""I could dance with Abe Lincoln himself""

Margaret (b. ATL) found a porcelain pin among the post-War rubble, cleaned it, set it on the mantel, began to dreaming, put that to words and called it Gone-With-The-Wind.

What do you write about a 4 hr epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable), charming characters (Melanie & Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.

If you are of the politically correct persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you have a warm heart, like its strings tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and a movie, you'll find the time needed to drink in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent. Others could've played Scarlett, no doubt to good reviews (Davis Oberon Goddard), but only one could've become Mitchell's buoyant belle (Leigh). It's clearly her movie but it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d.43) had balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee, learned men clinging to a corrupt code who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) versus passion (Scarlett).

Those today with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming & Cukor, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which the pharmacology industry holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.

PC is the new Red Scare, Blue, as it were, a power grab no more progressive than the red variety was patriotic. It makes blacklists, kills classic art and business responds as it did in the 50s, with fear, rather than education and dialogue. Non-conformity is still the crime, charged un-American then, racist in the new millennium. As corporations own the rights to most vintage movies and their target market, youth, typically have no interest in vintage art, expect holders in coming years to edit or remove from sale & display, classics broadly deemed unsuitable by the PC police, likely leading to creation of a 30s style (pre-Code), illicit film genre called pre-PC, for those that survive.

If you've a boycott bee in your bonnet because of unpleasant characterizations (Prissy) & historical telling of events, consider, when Big Sam saves Scarlett at the bridge and Rhett does mix n' mingle with Mammy over bourbons (2d half is Butler's movie), the film's makers are firing an early round for Civil Rights. Does GWTW romanticize events? Of course it does (""Cavaliers""), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4).",10/10,24 February 2020,StevenKeys,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
No other movie makes me more divided..,"I watched GWTW for the first time in the late 90's. I have to admit that as teenager I was quite disappointed. This is considered one of THE movies of all time and I found it hard to enjoy for a number of reasons.

The lead: Scarlett O'Hara is not a likable character. She is selfish and egocentric and just mostly annoying. Since then I have to a degree learned to enjoy a little bit her will power but the character will always remain a disappointment to me.

""Edit 210810: Since writing this review I have realized that Victor Fleming wanted Scarlett to be depicted in a quite bad way since she was a Southerner. I never thought of that before and that makes sense.. It doesn't change my opinion about the movie but I understand why its lead is what she is. End edit""

The acting: I know it was the melodramatic way in those days but it's just not natural. First few scenes I watched I could hardly believe it since they felt SO overplayed. Since then I have watched a lot more old movies and learned to accept it but still..

Ashley: Leslie Howard was a great actor but miscast here and he felt so himself. According to several sources he was also completely indifferent. To this day I can't understand that David O'Selznick thought that was the best choice for the part.

But there are of course also reasons why this probably is the most famous movie of all time.

The photo/scenery: for 1939 nothing short of absolutely sensational. Hard to believe really and decades before it's time.

The soundtrack: also, put into context, one of the greatest of all time.

To a degree, the story: yes it is a ""civil war soap opera"" but the story is quite ok and some of the characters rather interesting.

So.. since that first viewing I have actually come to enjoy it for what it is. It will never be a favorite but it fascinates me more than many other movies.

Of course I have to finish talking a little bit about the racism issues because of BLM as well.

I get it. I get what annoys people about this movie. Still.. I feel that the criticism is exaggerated and IS exaggerated because of the fame and praise for this movie.

Because I don't feel blacks are badly portrayed or mistreated in an unacceptable way. Ok, I know they complain about stereotypical portrayal and ""happy slaves"" but I don't really agree actually.. loyal servants more than slaves, absolutely, but happy? Was that kind of relationship never the case in any household? Were slaves always treated badly by their owners and beaten etc.? In some cases, absolutely, but who wanted to watch that in 1939? Would it have been a better option to show the owners torturing their slaves than showing a decent relationship? To me, I doubt it.. And the movie is still set during the civil wat so there WERE slaves.. as tragic as that fact is.

I know that Selznick put a lot of effort in trying not to affend anyone and I think he did a decent job no matter the criticism of today.

By the way, you can also argue for the fact that Southerners were portrayed as naive and smug going into that war with such limited resources and also that the Yankees were bloodthirsty barbarians who just killed everyone in their way. About that there is not much talk..

Finally.. to put things in perspective there is one other classic movie that I will never watch because of its obvious racism and that is ""Birth of a Nation"". From what I have learned it's unacceptable even by 1915 standards. GWTW has its flaws but it's not even close to that level and again, considering it was made 1939 I think it is a decent watch on all levels.",7/10,28 July 2020,eb-77766,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Most overrated film I have ever seen...,"Okay. That's a pretty bold statement, so I'm going to try to defend it as completely as I can. I am willing to acknowledge that the film is very nicely presented. The acting is excellent, the sets are good, and of course the color is magnificent. I'm sure it was even more magnificent at the time. But that's not enough to make a good movie, and pretty much everything else about this movie is completely off.

First of all, this whole film is based on the idealization of the south and the demonization of the north, and I find that highly objectionable. I could deal with it if it were a question of showing the perspective of the people living back in that time and their values. That would be a genuinely interesting thing to do, and it's the sort of thing Goodfellas does. But that's not what this is. It's a complete fantasy-denial that anything bad ever happened in the South and that there were any redeeming virtues to the North. I need not delve into the actual historical picture of the South, or the actual ugliness of slavery, or the actual behaviors of the soldiers and carpetbaggers. Look it up if you don't know. Oh, and don't get me started on the racism in this movie. It was practically intolerable.

But even besides that, the plot is wrong. This did not need to be four hours long. Worse yet, after sitting through those four hours, you don't get anything. It feels like Wagner's The Ring. A lot of people are dead, but other than that, everything is precisely where it was at the beginning for our characters. Rhett is wandering, and Scarlett is at Tara. Great. And there were problems along the way too. At no point was there any remotely sympathetic character. This can be handled well, but really wasn't here. A lot of the people kept changing character, like Rhett caring for no one one second and then fighting for the Lost Cause the next, or Scarlett continually swinging between having courage and whining helplessly all the time. And I won't bother to try and summarize the plot. I doubt you can either without naming every event because it meanders around pointlessly. At one point it's a romance, then it's about a lumber yard, then who-knows-what. It comes out to four hours of rambling, Confederate nothing.

Frankly, I think if this had worse actors and was in black and white, no one would have heard of it. There's nothing much going on. Catch Lawrence of Arabia if you want a good old epic film.

'Gone with the Wind',"Gone with the Wind is a 1939 American epic historical romance film adapted from the 1936 novel by Late Margaret Mitchell.

The film stars Late Clark Gable, Late Vivien Leigh, Late Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland in the leads.

The film depicts love story of lead couple amidst the American Civil War.

One of the best films that I've seen in the recent times. The film might be enduring 4 hours long and might test the patience of the viewers but despite of the length of the film the film will not bore you and will keep you mesmerized.

Acting is the strongest aspect of the film and all the characters were just mesmerizing. All the characters and side characters were amazing. The screenplay of the film is slow but effective.

"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn""","What can I say about this now legendary movie that hasn't been stated numerous times already? When adjusted for inflation, Gone With the Wind is still the most profitable movie ever made 80 years after its debut. Even audiences a day after its release were in love with this movie, due to the superb acting, casting, civil war setting, and of course, all of it made even more impressive by the use of Technicolor. Believe it or not, this was the first color movie to win an Oscar, which may surprise many people. The question that remains in many minds is whether or not the film is still worth looking at almost a century later, and the answer is yes. 1939 may have not been a very good time for Europe because of what was about to begin later that year, but many film critics cite this year as being one of Hollywood's best. So many classic movies were released in just this one year, including things like Wizard of Oz, Ninotchka, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Women, and this one. One of the primary reasons why Gone With the Wind still holds its magic after all these decades is because the story itself is timeless. Hundreds of years ago, love stories were as prominent as they are now, and I'm sure they'll be around in the coming centuries as well. Because the plot of the movie is centered around this type of narrative, it will never go out of style. Add on to this big name actors playing the parts, such as Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, and you are given a recipe for perfection. Despite it being a romance story at its core, Gone With the Wind is much more complicated than just that. The story starts (much like the novel) on the eve of the american civil war. It is the year 1861, and the gorgeous Scarlett O'Hara is living in sunny and humid Georgia with her parents, who happen to be slaveowners. Being Irish, she is pondering the idea of marrying someone who resembles someone from her ancestral homeland. To this end, she decides to approach Ashley Wilkes, but he rejects her, planning to enter an incestuous relationship with his cousin Melanie (de Havilland) instead. Shortly after, Scarlett meets a tall and suitable love interest in the form of Rhett Butler (Gable), but they are rudely interrupted when news arrives telling everyone that the Confederate military has attacked the Union held Fort Sumter, beginning the civil war. This event (predictably) turns everyone's lives upside down, and a man who Scarlett later marries (who isn't Rhett) is killed in the war. Meanwhile, the conflict is going badly for the Confederacy, and their luck runs out at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Scarlett manages to run away back to her hometown of Tara, only to learn her mother is dead from typhoid and her father is delirious. Once the war is over, Scarlett's father tries to ride after a troublemaker on his horse, but falls off of it and dies. The movie then attempts to connect this part with the beginning by bringing back Ashley, but he still doesn't want to be with Scarlett. Rhett eventually marries her instead, and they have a daughter whom they name Bonnie Blue (after the nickname of the first flag given to the confederacy). Despite this accomplishment, Scarlett doesn't seem to like Rhett anymore because he finds out she only wants Ashley. After getting in a verbal fight with him, Scarlett falls and suffers a miscarriage. It gets even worse when her daughter tries to jump a fence while riding a small horse (just like Scarlett's father) and the impact ends up killing her. Annoyingly, after all the abuse she's been through, Scarlett changes her mind again and tells Rhett she wants to be with him as he's getting ready to leave her life forever. He says his famous line, and Scarlett promises to regain his affection someday as the film ends. The first time watching this, I really didn't expect an ending so abrupt. Personally, I think it could have gone on much longer, especially considering how Melanie is dying towards the end of the movie because of the stress pregnancy put on her. In any case, Gone With the Wind is already almost 4 hours in length and that is all most audiences will be able to watch in one sitting. I saw this movie last year for the first time and was not the same afterwards. It really is incredible how they managed to do all this in the 30s with no access to computers or anything like that. Only the most determined people can assemble something of this magnitude. Yes, it helps that the entire layout for the story was already on display for all to see in a novel, but adapting all of it for the big screen must have been a huge challenge. It's a good thing they decided to use color for this movie because you wouldn't get the full effect of the civil war setting otherwise. It is mostly remembered as a war that happened in black and white, but that's not the reality. By watching this film, we can see it as people in the 1860s saw it, in all its horrors. The burning city of Atlanta, the vibrant colors of the plantations, and the beautiful countryside of Georgia are all brought to life here. Unsurprisingly, the casting is also excellent. Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, the main character, but is overshadowed by Rhett in many ways. She is, in a way, foolish, and changes her mind way too often about who she is romantically interested in. This indecisiveness ultimately leads to the one person she truly loved disappearing from her life forever. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler may seem like a fairly stable, moderate guy since he is shown to love Scarlett and even ends up marrying her, but the longer their marriage goes on, the more strained it becomes. By the finale, his patience is exhausted, and feels no pity for Scarlett when she tells him she'll never find someone like him again. Olivia de Havilland plays Melanie, Ashley's cousin (and love interest). She's not featured as prominently as Scarlett, but her character still has an important part in the story. She's the main reason stopping Ashley from being with Scarlett. The music in the film consists of many songs written during the civil war, such as Dixie and Bonnie Blue Flag, and you might notice they're all southern songs because that's where it takes place. There's also the theme for the town of Tara which has become rather iconic, and is usually the unofficial theme song of this movie. Anyone with a brain can deduce that Gone With the Wind was also insanely popular when it came to awards as well. In 1940, it set a record for Oscar wins and nominations, won 8, and was nominated for 13. This record stood until 1958 when Gigi won 9 oscars, and Ben Hur the following year won 11. This enormous mountain of praise is but one of the reasons why people should watch this movie, even 80 years after its release. It is one of very few films that is basically flawless and strong in all categories. The casting is great, the acting is great, the music is memorable and exciting, and the story is as timeless as the universe itself. It really is among the best movies ever made, if not the best.

This is an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see,"Gone with the Wind (1939) is a movie that was my grandmother's all time favorite film that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the struggles of a young lady with a lot of pride and moxie and love for money and fortune and the lifestyle that goes with it. She resides in the south as they are about to head into the civil war, during the civil war and as the south initially emerges from the war. She, like most of the south, experiences lots of tragedy because of the war but she does a lot of it to herself. This movie is directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) and stars Clark Gable (Mutiny on the Bounty), Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Names Desire), Barbara O'Neil (Tower of London), George Reeves (The Adventures of Superman) and Fred Crane (A Gay Amigo). The storyline for this picture is absolutely incredible with the characters being so dynamic, unpredictable and stubborn. The backdrops and landscapes were beautiful and well shot. The cinematography for this age was impressive - every set, house details, dress and prop was magnificent. The troubling circumstances honestly made me laugh, like the characters were getting what they deserved based on their beliefs. The action scenes, various fights and gun shots were great. There were so many dramatic sequences in this that were mesmerizing and well executed and really keeps the audience glued to the movie despite its run time.

Golden age of Hollywood (even with the whitewashing),"I can't add much more to the reviews that handbooks on filmmaking haven't already. It epitomizes the golden age of Hollywood. It's grand. It's a technical marvel. It has the most iconic romance since Romeo and Juliet. Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh has more quotable lines than anybody else. Is there a better line than Rhett Butler's ""No, I don't think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.""? It is bigger than a simple movie.

However, the more modern critiques have centered on the treatment of the slavery issue, and the general whitewashing of that 'civilization'. It's a fair criticism, but it misses the times and the subject matter. The movie isn't about slavery. It's a fable of its times. I won't be subtracting any points. I don't want to add retroactive morality to my review.

Most of the black characters are noble subservients in the movie. It's understandable to object to the portrayal. However, Sam is one of the more heroic persona. Other than Priss and the carpetbagger, they weren't stupid or mean spirited. I think the best description is whitewashing. They covered up the brutality, and gave it a nice gleaming coat. For its times, I don't think we can expect more. Slavery in The Patriot (2000) was marginally more realistic than this. To me, that seems much more egregious.",10/10,27 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Gone But Not Forgotten,"I was dating at the time this came out in a small theater on Hollywood blvd for a short run. Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it. We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music, characters, story-line and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together. Unknown to me, when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that. We got up to go and found out it was only intermission. I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more. We were not disappointed either. When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more. A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime. Since then, I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it. I bought the collectors sets (vhs) and finally the DVD. Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end. Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another day....Good movie to eat with while watching

"In my view, the greatest film of all time","I know that many do not agree that GWTW is the greatest film of all time, but I think they don't put the film in the perspective of time. Think of the production values, the risks in making the film, the richness of color, and the brilliant performances that have stood the test of time -- all from 1939!!!!!!!!!! I have watched this film many times, but tonight for the first time I watched the Blu-Ray edition. I am nearly stunned at the picture clarity of a film that is 72 years old! The screenplay is brilliant, particularly when you consider how much was packed into 3:40. Although they are episodic, for example in the second half of the movie you watch a marriage disintegrate, and see how often both Scarlett and Rhett could have made things better by simply modifying some simple word or phrase or body language. And, in the first half of the film, the horror of the Civil War is portrayed beautifully by the suffering of the soldiers in the hospital scenes or the pullback scene of the bodies at the railroad depot.

And then there are the performances. Clark Gable had long been ""The King"", but this was his role of a lifetime. It eclipsed anything he had done before, and never again did he reach the dramatic heights he displayed in this film. It was much the same for Vivien Leigh, although she had not had such a long and successful film career previous to GWTW, and due to her mental illness had a limited career afterward. I've read that some people are not impressed with Leslie Howard's performance as Ashley Wilkes. But, I think it's it's the role that causes that, because the Wilkes character was such a wimp...but I think Howard (with whom I'm not generally impressed) played this role so well. Olivia deHavilland was superb here, as well, although she had many fine roles in her career. Thomas Mitchell is excellent as ""Pa"", even more so after he lost his mind...the best role of his career. And then there are the supporting actors who lend something special to this film -- Aunt Pittypat (Laura Hope Crews in a classic role), Hattie McDaniels, Butterfly McQueen, and a long time favorite -- Harry Davenport.

""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Ben-Hur"" are ""9s"", but GWTH is still the gold standard!

A powerful movie about the hardships of Reconstruction and Civil War.,"Gone with the Wind is a classic Civil War movie that recognizes the of faults of the War. The protagonist of the Gone with the Wind is Scarlett, who struggles through the hardships of Reconstruction and the Civil War. Gone with the Wind shows the weaknesses and strengths of the struggles of Reconstruction and how life was to be lived during the Civil War.Scarlett can be described as determined as she drives to achieve everything she desires. Scarlett aims to win Ashley Wilkes, and her failure to do so guides the plot of the novel. Scarlett loses her true love, Rhett Butler, because of her persistent desire to win Ashley. Gone with the Wind is based in the South. The movie is very persistent in allowing the viewer(s) to know that the Yankees in the war,are the bad people. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you she plays the role of Scarlett perfectly. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish spoilt Scarlett, she is larger than life.The complicated relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. The performance done by these characters really allows the viewers to feel the urge of the desire portrayed by the characters to try and make their relationships work. Both parties would do anything for each other. Despite Scarlett's hardness, she grows as a person. She slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. At the end of the movie, she finally realizes how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there. She realizes that she really does love Rhett and would do anything she could to get him back, so she goes after him.

One of the all-time greats,"As a millennial, it is important for all fellow millennials to remember to not watch this film from a 21st century perspective. In order to appreciate Gone With The Wind, or any old classic film, one must watch it from the perspective of the period it was filmed as well as the period it describes. Certainly, the portrayal of the African-American characters is very dated, but that takes nothing away from how these roles were performed. Furthermore, while most today would disagree with the film's sympathetic disposition towards the south during the Civil War, everyone can agree that Gone With The Wind does an incredible job of highlighting the monumental costs of a war - the loss of lives, the strain put on those left behind afterwards, and the horribly wasteful drain of resources, money, and emotion that a war causes for everyone involved.

Another thing Gone With The Wind did extremely well was to abandon the traditional roles of heroes and heels and instead blur those lines, showing the good and bad qualities of every character. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler spent his entire life as a slimy, womanizing sleazeball, yet demonstrated numerous times that he has a huge heart. Vivien Leigh as Scarlett was a very selfish, crass, and heartless person, yet showed the strength and resilience to persevere through any hard situation thrown her way. Olivia de Havilland portrayed Melly as an incredibly warm, caring, sweet individual who cared deeply for everyone around her, but suffered from naïvety and an inability to truly care about herself. Just to note for Olivia fans, this role is a must-see because it was the first role that removed her from the standard ""beautiful girl pursued by the lead man"" roles that Warner typically gave her, and it truly gave her an opportunity to show off her acting chops like never before. Leslie Howard's Ashley was the strong war hero yet was too weak to fight off Scarlett's continuous tempting advances. Last to mention but certainly not least was Hattie McDaniel as Mammy. She may have been portrayed as an uneducated house slave, yet several times was the smartest character in a scene.

There are a couple characters who could've been done better, though. Victor Jory was a brilliant heel character actor, and Jonas Wilkinson was one of the few true heels in the film, yet he was confined to just a handful of scenes and was quite insignificant overall. Butterfly McQueen as Prissy was insufferable. It's not clear who told her to act like that or why they did, but her lines almost exclusively consist of screaming and extreme overacting, and her scenes are extremely painful to watch. She does have one worthwhile moment in the film though - to avoid a complete spoiler, just watch her lips.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gone With The Wind is the cinematography. The color is gorgeous, and the HD copies of the film available today make it look like it was filmed just a few years ago. The use of thousands of extras in the outdoor hospital scene was very impactful. The fire scene was absolutely brilliant. Long-distance shots are used perfectly throughout the film. If someone wasn't told what year this film was made, it is highly doubtful that anyone would guess it dates all the way back to 1939. It could easily pass for the 90s. It looks THAT good.

Overall, this is one of the all-time greats of classic film. Gone With The Wind is a must-watch for all classic film buffs!",10/10,23 May 2020,rebel_sgeezy89,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"Finally, I've seen this classic, too.","It's always fun to find out where The Simpsons get their inspiration. Here, it's the iconic image of Scarlet O'Hara standing underneath the giant tree (saying ""There's always tomorrow."") that was used in 'Principal Charming'. The Technicolor look of 'Gone with the wind' is pretty amazing, for instance in the aforementioned scene, and otherwise mostly in similar grand scenes and images. During the film I had guessed the film was from the fifties, so discovering that it was made in 1939 rather blew my mind.

I loved this movie, but only up until just after the ending of the Civil War. Then it became much more like a soap opera (though still better than your average soap series), focusing mostly on Scarlet and Rhett Butler and their turbulent 'romantic' times. I can't say I got bored with it, nor was it really bad, but their characters went all over the place without really convincing me of their sincerity. Still, it's not hard to see how this is a classic, and I'm very likely to give it another chance some other time. Scarlet O'Hara is in any case a terrific movie character that will stick with me for a good while - great balls of fire!

Until then, a big 7 out of 10.

pro-Confederate travesty of history,"This move travesties the history of the war and especially of the Reconstruction, which was not at all the disaster that pro-Southern historians and their sympathizers would have us believe. This film is awash, as one would expect, in nostalgia for the ancien regime, and not even the charm of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable can make me forget that fact. Such scenes as the one in which the director has an African-American character riding along in a carriage singing Marching Through Georgia are obviously meant to inspire bitterness and resentment in the viewer, and the Federal troops are uniformly portrayed as brutes. This is nothing but polite version of Birth of a Nation--at least so far as its politics go.

Winds of war,"The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.

It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade.

But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance.

It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.

However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.

Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that...",9/10,20 September 2015,Lejink,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"It is a controversial movie, true...","Here is how I feel about Gone With the Wind. My mom's side of the family is Southern. They lived mostly around where Scarlett and her gang hung out. Some had plantations and owned slaves. My grandparents were ""old fashioned"" in the clueless way Margaret Mitchell was. I've heard their side lots of times, and I found it to be wrong. If I were Black, I wouldn't like to pass by statues erected to past oppressors either, nor would I want to have flags in my face constantly reminding me of a sorrowful past.

However, please consider this.

1. If you're going to get upset at GWTW and ban showing it, then you would also want to eliminate the rest of the movies from back then which show stereotypes as well, correct? Unfortunately, ALMOST ALL, probably about 98% of Black roles for the stage and screen pre-1960's were just as racist as in GWTW, many were worse.

The problem is, if you get rid of these movies, you erase the work of any Black actors back then as well. You won't see why Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for a performance in a land so bigoted, she could not sit in the audience during the premiere. You won't see lots of superb singing, dancing, and acting by any African-American during this time. They will be completely ignored because of the context.

You wind up punishing all these people who wanted to work in entertainment and had little influence over the roles they played as well as those whites who made those movies.

And...

2. Hollywood whitewashes and pretties up EVERYTHING. It always has. Don't get upset because they did it for the millionth time in GWTW.

Consider the movie ""300"", about ancient Sparta. There was no mention of slaves they owned, or the organized pedophilia that went into the training of boys (Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about).

And yet, there were no mass protests at the rose colored vision in the movie. No one came to picket the film because it omitted a horrendous flaw in Spartan society.

Why? Well, for one thing, that was well over 2000 years ago. What happened in Sparta is no longer directly relevant to anyone. No normal, modern army expects raping young boys as part of their training.

It's no longer relevant.

Unfortunately, GWTW IS STILL RELEVANT. Many of the problems portrayed in this film and any film from back then with Black actors are still haunting the U.S.. Denying that there is anything wrong and everything is just fine and has been fixed is simply denying reality.

Why do I care? Unfortunately, GWTW is one of my favorite books and films. It has a strong, still unique story of feminism I can relate to. That is what is relevant to me in the film. I have tended in the past to brush aside the slave part because it seems surreal to me to own people. I'm certainly not sitting there, hoping the ""good ol' days"" can come back. I like the modern world with its aim of acceptance and tolerance. I get the feeling the vast majority of viewers feel the same way.

How do we solve this problem? When Blacks are truly integrated, and that day will come, then GWTW will no longer be that relevant. It won't strike any raw nerves. The protests will die down, just as they have for every other hot button issue who's time has come and gone.

True classics never die. GWTW has many redeeming features which have made it endlessly entertaining to me and thousands of other people. Keep talking about it, show the movie now and then with perhaps a short lecture on history and context before, and know that in time, the pain will fade.

ALSO, KEEP IN MIND, when you criticize Scarlett for her actions, there was NO OTHER WAY to survive in the Victorian world if you were a woman other than SEDUCING A MAN. It's not like she could go off to college and get a degree. Women were NOT allowed to own land, have a bank account,vote, hold a job (besides perhaps a hat maker or, much more commonly, a prostitute) etc. If she seems strange for marrying men she didn't love,keep in mind it was that, or be totally broke and homeless.

Much of the criticism of her character comes from total lack of knowledge about this context.

As for the movie itself. I first saw it when I was thirteen. It made quite an impression. Forty years or so later, it still moves me. Some people criticize the main character, Scarlett, because she's ""not nice"". She's not ""typical"" of a main female character.

Scarlett behaves in an uncomfortably realistic way. She's not a nice lady, she is a super-rare female anti-hero. She's not comfortingly evil, but she's never going to be a goody two shoes. Some people don't know how to handle that.

Melanie, on the other hand, is criticized for being ""unrealistic"". I would ask anyone who thinks that to understand the context of the times she lived in. There was no mass media, save for the local newspaper, and that was hardly an international trove of information as they are now. No TV, no radio, no internet. A person could grow up to be innocent in a way we simply don't experience in modern society.

It's a movie about survival. And it's a war movie without battle scenes. I would urge you to watch it.

Scarlet's eyes,"Say what you will about Scarlet O'Hara, Gone With the Wind was a classic when it came out in 1939 and it will remain a classic for years to come. A movie marvel, Gone With the Wind was a triumph to be made. Not a single weak link in the film, Gone With the Wind is an example of what an American film should be. Unlike GIANT, Gone With the Wind does not represent the American Blockbuster. Instead, it represents everything good about film. The acting, direction, the production, the story, it all came into place with Gone With the Wind.

A great American classic,"'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.

The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.

Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie.",10/10,7 January 2004,rbverhoef,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
65th Anniversary DVD is a must,"If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece, you'll be swayed by the 65th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 4-disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day (after watching the film, of course). The two-hour making-of documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer (David O. Selznick) of the film affected the cast, director(s) and writer(s) -- and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett. The feature of Olivia De Havilland (in 2004) discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat. The picture and sound are great on the 65th Anniversary DVD, and the special features are a true treasure. Accept no substitutes, seek out the 65th Anniversary DVD and bring it home.

twenty twenty two,"Gone With the Wind is a title that has been stuck in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, although I had never watched it until recently. I had preconceived notions of the film, I thought that it would be not only incredibly boring but ignorantly racist as well. And while I cannot deny the obvious romanticism of the Civil War era that was not historically accurate, a product of its time, this movie was anything but boring. For a film made in 1939, the visual and performance aspects of the movie are incredibly impressive. Vivian Leigh's performance as Scarlett radiated off the screen to depict the vivacious, determined and selfish southern belle, whose disillusionment of love and greed is what led her throughout the movie. This performance is just simply unparalleled even today. Gone With the Wind's ability to stay relevant and the highest grossing film in 2022 is extremely impressive.

Gone With Vivien Leigh.,"When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. ""Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee"", they said. Without a shadow of doubt, ""Gone With The Wind"" based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a ""woman's picture"" & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was ""no effing good"" & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her ""As God Is My Witness"" speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie.",No rating,27 June 2015,Hotwok2013,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Scarlett Dreams,"Producer David O Selznick offered Margaret Michell $50,000 for the rights to ""Gone With the Wind"". That was the highest amount paid for a first-time novel at the time. Selznick wanted Clark Gable in the lead role, but because the star was busy, Selznick was forced to postpone the film for two years. The producer used the waiting time to search for the right actress to play Gable's love interest.

The movie is set in the American South against the backdrop of the Civil War. It tells the story of the strong-willed daughter of a plantation owner and her romance with a handsome, but roguish racketeer.

Finding a suitable candidate for the female lead would prove more difficult than expected. More than 1,400 women were tested before Selznick decided on a young Vivien Leigh. The choice of director was also problematic. George Cukor started the film, but after a few weeks he was fired and replaced by Victor Flemming.

In fact, everything about ""Gone With the Wind"" was big and complicated. For example the destruction of Atlanta. The film crew burned many old sets that needed to be cleared from the studio lot, including the great wall from ""King Kong"". The fire was so intense that Culver City residents jammed the telephone lines, thinking the whole MGM Studio was burning down.

At the Academy Awards ""Gone With the Wind"" took home eight Oscars. Among them Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American to receive the accolade, beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland. David O Selznick won an Oscar for best picture.

Tragically, ""Gone With the Wind"" overshadowed the rest of Selznick's career. In an interview shortly before his death the producer said that he felt that he had wasted his life trying to outdo it.",7/10,20 November 2022,Prince-P,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"If you ever (thought you) wanted something you couldn't have, you need to watch this film","Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex.

Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not.

The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.

This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.",10/10,10 August 2013,AlsExGal,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Deserves it's legendary reputation,"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""

One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride.

They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance.

Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable.

The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.",7/10,12 May 2013,paulsrobinson,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Mother of all soap operas,"Unfortunately Gone with the Wind remains a most overrated film in history. It tells us a story of a spoiled, egoistic girl, incapable of loving anybody but herself, ready to do anything to have her stomach filled. What is her turning to Rhett for money to restore her Tara but a kind of walking the panel? If that's a heroine what are the nation's morals? Unfortunately it is Vivien Leigh that saved the film. If it were not for her nobody would have noticed this run-of-the -mill production. It has no cultural or intellectual worth. At least it has no story to tell the world. I am sure that American history could have furnished a film crew with a better plot or a more breathtaking love story. Only incurable pragmatics can learn something from this film and this is how to kill a human being in oneself to earn money. Scarlett is a failure and a disaster in everything, she couldn't even look properly after her own child. If she had had an eye open for her daughter nothing of the kind would have happened. On the whole, the rich also weep, soap gives suds and leaves scum behind.

A Snapshot of History On Film,"Th the story of the South and the Stiff neck society is perfectly isolated in film forever. This film is NOT about race, but about a period of TIME, a portrayal of the lifestyle of the South at that time. Rhett is a Profiteer, Scarlet a hopeless spoiled romantic, the upper crust despising a ""slave auction"" of white women to raise $ for ""The Cause"". And Hattie McDonald... the portrayal of a Loving, caring, nurturing outspoken mammy. (Which is a Derivative if MOMMY). This movie need be watched as an example of a Moment in time. Of an impolite society doing its best to be ""polite"" under false pretense. It HAS HISTORICAL VALUE. The costumes, the settings, the burning of Atlanta. Margaret Mitchell had it right, this is an Epic story with which each subsequent viewing enlightens one on the understandings of human nature and self-determination. Hattie Mc Daniel is the best, Butterfly McQueen May have portrayed a stereotype... however we MUST view this story as an epic almost mythological tale of the beginnings of Civil Rights.

"phenomenal then, absolutely perfect now.","This is by far one of the best films i have ever watched. Yes, i know the time length can be difficult to commit to, but it is worth every minute. This is one of the few films that have me stuck to my seat and quite frankly, i would've loved for it to go on forever. The character development is wonderful to watch play out, all actors bring their all to the table and even the small details like the setting, design and appearance of actors was just perfect. I have re watched this film once a year and it never fails to impress me. I have forced friends to give it a chance and watch it with me and midway thru they refuse to even get up for a water break cause they're just as amazed as i was watching for the first time. I will never stop recommending this film, it brings so many genres to the table and the story is just phenomenal to witness.

Gone With the Wind Review,"Gone with the Wind is an amazzzzzzzzzzzzzzingly long yet a wonderful classic film! The cinematography by Ernest Haller is truly gorgeous and add beautifully to the story as a whole. The story duration of this film is spanned over many years which seemed to drag the plot on for quite some time, especially since the screen duration is 238 minutes. But, for the most part the plot moved relatively at a fast pace. The plot was very complex. It had many love affairs going on at one time (love triangles), had the men at war and the women at home, and the multiple deaths of loved ones. I personally think that Scarlett should have given up on Ashley for Rhett Butler wayyyy before she did. This would have made the story line way more interesting. I also wished that they showed a little bit more of the men actually fighting in the war to get a gist of what that would have been like. I loved the scene when all the hundreds of bodies of the men were laying out on the ground and here comes Scarlett with her pink dress on looking for the Doc to deliver Melanie's baby. That was also a great use of cinematography. The above camera angle was perfect for that scene. Overall, even though the film was ridiculously long I did happen to thoroughly enjoy it!

Everything you think it would be and more!! Gone With The Wind lives up to it's powerful reputation,"I waited 28 year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind. Four plus hours long? 1939? It was as old as my Dad. But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch it...since then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times. Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking. It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on. Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and it's pretty easy to see why. Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the 'special effects' the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone 65 years ago. The raging war, the fields being worked, the attacks being carried out, the people evacuating, and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war. Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and you've got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existed.

Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara. One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie history...probably top 3. Leigh's Scarlett will remain in your memory forever. Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise her...she's whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero. She's a strong female lead and her performance is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the greatest characters in movie history. Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler. At first I thought Gable's performance lacked depth. I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about. Rhett Butler had this air of over-confidence, a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties. His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine. Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years. Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which we've never known. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role. The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them. They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as 'Mammy' their beloved house servant. Leslie Howard as Scarlett's love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes. Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes (who marries Ashley away from Scarlett.) She was terrific in her role, one of the best characters in the film. Harry Davenport, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Butterfly McQueen...so so so many other terrific performances in this film. Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves (Superman), and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables.)

For years I haven't been a fan of old classics. Just now am I getting around to watching them but if you're the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind. It's LONG, there is no doubt about it but it's utter brilliance, story, action, romance, and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted. I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest. I don't know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end. One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again. 10/10

"GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, it's terrific!","There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than ""Gone with the wind"". It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.

I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it.

It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.

In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!

I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book: so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for ""Stagecoach"" that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.

Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.

Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for ""To each his own"" and ""The Heiress""). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.

If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it.",10/10,7 July 2007,HowToCarrieOn,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"""Sir, you are no gentleman."" ""And you, Miss, are no lady.""","GONE WITH THE WIND is an epic melodrama which is very difficult to describe. Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.

Gone with the Wind is a love story at the time of the Civil War, in which each in its own way serves some human punishment.

Although I am aware of racist moment that really exists in the film, I would not have acted rudely. Although the ""slaves"" happy and complex, their characterization is not at all realistic. This is best seen when they become part of the romance or love affairs of their ""masters"". The film is quite delicate and subtle. Some erotic themes are, to the extent permissible content, quite convincing.

Set design, costume design, framing, story, theme and music are top notch. From the first sequence can be seen magic and suggest that this movie is very expensive.

Gable (Rhett Butler) and Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) are excellent. Scarlett is the central figure, and Rhett's character who meets her. Both characters are outlaws, unaccepted and stubborn. Perfect for each other, or just doomed?

Howard (Ashley Wilkes) and de Havilland (Melanie Hamilton) are boring. However, when acting individually their good acting comes into play. They look great in a pair with the main two characters. It is interesting that even they do not fit into the concept of people from the South.

Novel. So many tragic figure, none of which is happy. One persistent striving toward the one she can not have, and when it gets it is no longer interesting.

I always watch this movie with relish, while I do not feel numb ass.",9/10,9 May 2016,elvircorhodzic,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
scarlett,"After seeing the film Gone with Wind I felt into deep thought. The image of the main actress Scarlett haunted me all the time. In my eyes, she is the most successful shaped image in the film. Even though she undeniably has some shortcoming, I still admire her. It is those flaws in her personality that add to the perfection completeness and vividness character.

She, Scarlett, had something strong and special on her, such as great determination, strong willpower, etc. once she decided to do something, she never gave it up and stuck to it until she reached her goals. She was strong-minded, brave, and could adapt to a new situation acutely. She, not like Ishley, faced the cruel reality undauntedly, instead of trying to avoid it. (We can't escape from it, when it comes, what we should do is face the music.) Let¡¯s see a example here. After the arrival of home, Scarlett fond nothing left on the homeyard---no food, no clothes, no mother since Negroes were set free, to survive, she yielded herself to work hard on the farm as a farmer. Her sisters were so loyal to the previous life and hated Scarlett for her forcing them to work in the fields. Anyhow, the homeyard had a good turnover. At the moment she was informed that she would lose her farm and house unless she paid 300 gold coins for the tax. All she had amounted to less than 10 gold coins in total. What could she do? To give in? No, not a chance. She ran around those old acquaintances to collect the money. She hated to borrow money Relter, who was her last hope. However, she decided to meet him in the disguise of the new dress made of curtain. All she had done was a complete waste. Relter was so playful and refused her. Bu chance she met Flank, her sister's financee and tricked him into marrying her, which added to hate of her sister for her and to criticism of the people on her. This seemingly revealed that Scarlett was a bad person. But just let us think about it. Do you believe that her sister would give the money to the family to get rid of the tax after her marriage? Scarlett knew sister better than us. She was wise to do that. All she did was for the good of the tara, her family. That Scarlett did something people at that time thought bad didn't mean she was bad. On the opposite side, she was a person with the completeness of personality. She could do something different and something that the people had never done or had dared to do before. At that time, woman wasn't considered as graceful to be a businesswoman and was criticized. By those who were conservative and loyal to their opinion about women. Scaelett had no notion of that. She knew if she had the ability, she could do that as well as men, so she took business as her career and indeed had done a good job. People's unfriendly reactions never stopped her. She was so strong headed a person that she was hardly shaky. Scarlett was so special and different, and set a good example to me. I¡¯ve learned a great deal both from Scarlett and the film, which is excellent one and is worth seeing.

True classic,"Gone with the Wind is a true classic that will never die, and even watching it today is a pleasant experience, unlike number of modern movies that are total trash. Story is about a young, arrogant and selfish Scarlett, who goes through all the hardships that Southerners went through during Civil War. She is not particularly ""good"" person nor ""evil"". She only thinks about her own well-being, does not care about her child and does not treat her Mammy well. That is the main issue of the movie for me, because I cannot sympathize with such character and thus cannot establish deep connection. Although, there are plenty of good movies that show antagonists as main characters, this one just did not work for me.

Nevertheless, nobody can deny astonishing directory, beautiful shots of sunsets and both rural and urban areas. The set, costumes and decorations - everything works perfectly to truly grasp the feeling of that era. Acting was just splendid, and all of the Oscar nominations and wins are truly worthy. But the most thing that hit me was the editing. An exemplary one to teach in film schools.

However, lack of personal attachments for the characters and depicting ""North"" as Yankees and simply barbarians that left only chaos and destruction made me feel uncomfortable, which is the reason for 7/10.

"Amazing Film every generation needs to see it, Can't be remade","""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy and free the slaves as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. But we've known that for years; the tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 60th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. For the story it wanted to tell, it was the right film at the right time. Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman. The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. And there is a joyous flamboyance in the visual style that is appealing in these days when so many directors have trained on the blandness of television. Consider an early shot where Scarlett and her father look out over the land, and the camera pulls back, the two figures and a tree held in black silhouette with the landscape behind them. Or the way the flames of Atlanta are framed to backdrop Scarlett's flight in the carriage. Some of the individual shots in ""GWTW"" still have the power to leave us breathless, including the burning of Atlanta, the flight to Tara and the ""street of dying men"" shot, as Scarlett wanders into the street and the camera pulls back until the whole Confederacy seems to lie broken and bleeding as far as the eye can see.",10/10,6 April 2022,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"Compelling story, iconic moments, and fantastic production value - but in a toxic context","A movie that's certainly worth watching, but it's hard not to be conflicted, and it's a tough one to rate.

Positives:
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding in their roles of these two selfish people, who, while difficult to like, spiral around each other and deliver iconic Hollywood moments. He recognizes they're cut from the same cloth and loves her for it, she sees the same thing and hates him. A sexual current runs through their relationship from the first time he undresses her with his eyes, and she remarks ""He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy."" Later he'll tell her ""You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how,"" and it's clear without saying it when he helps her what he wants in return (after all, he's ""not a marrying man""). Gable's character is perceptive throughout the movie, and he's an interesting mix of rogue, gallant, bemused observer, and doting father.








Negatives:








Summary: The film is insidious because the story, its characters, and its production value are all so compelling, and yet the background context is so toxic. Can we mentally set aside those gigantic elephants in the room, and forgive it? Is this like a romantic Southern version of 'War and Peace', where we note that in his epic, Tolstoy didn't write of the ownership and oppression to serfs? Can we see it as the viewpoint of a defeated secessionist country, and understand what de Havilland would say in an interview years later - that ""All countries have experienced war and defeat. And survival. They can identify with that film for, I think, that reason."" It's tough. Very tough. I can neither love not despise this film.",7/10,2 October 2018,gbill-74877,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Sooo long,"Gone with the wind is a landmark movie. There is no denying this. It is well acted. The production value, cinematography and sheer spectacle are all stellar.

But it's annoying. I know this movie was a product of its time and as such, portrayal of slavery and the south as an idyllic paradise was not as unacceptable then as it is today, but it still leaves a very sour taste in my mouth and greatly hampered my enjoyment of the film. Depicting slavery as innocuous is just not something I can overlook.

Now I said the film was annoying and this is not just referring to its distasteful representation of people of color. The protagonist herself is just rotten to the bone. She's not a psychopath or anything but she is just...the worst. She uses people as props in the puppet show she calls life and almost never shows kindness for kindness's sake. I know that's the point of the movie. Scarlett O' Hara is not supposed to be likeable and indeed, she does get her comeuppance at the end (even in the second act of the film she goes through some rough times) but her character still didn't land for me.

So, five stars because despite y qualms, this is clearly a well-made movie, with soaring production values and ambitious performances that keep the melodrama afloat. However, I rate films, books, music and all forms of media primarily on how much I enjoyed it and not as much on the quality, social zeitgeist or overall importance in the cultural milieu.

Goodbye, Gone with the Wind, you are finally Gone From My Watchlist.

Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith,"What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame.",10/10,23 November 2010,mjneu59,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE

An epic and heartbreaking film,"If you've got the time & patience, Gone with the Wind is well worth a watch. This iconic film, set against the backdrop of the Civil War, delivers a compelling drama with impressive costumes, remarkable set design, and memorable characters. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable do a good job of portraying their dislikeable characters in a way that doesn't make you completely hate them, but the real heart of the film is Olivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton. Her pure goodness keeps this story from becoming too cynical. I can see why this epic & heartbreaking tale has captivated audiences for almost a century.

A Study in Scarlett,"GONE WITH THE WIND (Selznick International, in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Victor Fleming, is the screen adaptation to Margaret Mitchell's best selling 1936 novel. Subtitled ""The Story of the Old South,"" it stars Clark Gable in his iconic role of Rhett Butler, but it's Vivien Leigh, the British actress, who plays its central character, Scarlett O'Hara, whose practically in every scene from start to finish. As much as this could have been titled SCARLETT O'HARA, GONE WITH THE WIND became the chosen title, though one of its most famous lines, ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" might have been sufficient. With a cast of thousands, produced in Technicolor, it also includes one of the most memorable scores ever conducted by Max Steiner. For baby boomers of the 1960s to 1980s who have never seen GONE WITH THE WIND would recognize the scoring best as the introduction to ""The Million Dollar Movie"" on WOR, Channel 9 in New York City. This is where the score and the legend of Scarlett O'Hara all began.

The plot, told in chapter form, begins in Tara where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), popular with many suitors as the Tarleton brothers (George Reeves and Fred Crane), but actually Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Ashley loves his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland), whom he intends to marry. Scarlett, daughter of Irish proud plantation owner, Gerald (Thomas Mitchell) and wife, Ellen (Barbara O'Neil), has two other sisters, Coreen (Ann Rutherford) and Suellen (Evelyn Keyes). The O'Hara's also have their Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) who has not only served the family, but becomes an crucial part in Scarlett's life. Before Ashley goes off to serve in the Civil War, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother, Charles (Rand Brooks), who soon makes her a widow. Scarlett becomes the interest of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a man with questionable reputation, having been expelled from West Point. After the war ends, Scarlett, being the sole factor of looking after Melanie and her newborn baby, tries keeping her plantation home from Jonas Wilkerson (Victor Jory) through his high taxing by marrying Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies, leaving Scarlett to take charge of his lumber business. Scarlett's marriage to Rhett Butler and daughter, Bonnie Blue (Cammie King) comes only as his hope for her to change her affections from Ashley to him. Co-starring Ona Munson (Belle Watling); Butterfly McQueen (Prissy); Harry Davenport (Doctor Meade); Jane Darwell, Laura Hope Crews, Isabel Jewell, Alicia Rhett, among many others.

While this production could have been told through two separate movies, with its sequel titled TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY, GONE WITH THE WIND, along with opening and closing overture, has the distinction of being the longest movie (225 minutes) of the 1930s. Some may claim the first half to be better than its second, or visa versa. As much as the plot elements differ from the novel, the final results proved favorable to make this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Along with Academy Award wins, including Best Picture, (Best Actress) Vivien Leigh, (Best Supporting Actresses) Olivia De Havilland and winner Hattie McDaniel), etc., Gable, who was nominated, didn't win. Though nobody can play Rhett Butler best than Clark Gable, a role he was born to play, he being in and out of the story through long stretches may be one of the reasons of his loss. Filled with memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the ones that stand out most the burning of Atlanta; Scarlett becoming prettier through the passage of time; Scarlett's catch phrase of ""Fiddle Dee-Dee,"" but nothing comes off best as Gable's closing line.

When GONE WITH THE WIND first played on commercial television in November 1976, it was a big event, having been reissued in theaters many times after its 1939 release. Distributed on home video in the 1980s and later DVD, it had played on various Ted Turner cable channels, notably Turner Classic Movies since its humble beginning in 1994. Currently restored, TCM is where the movie is going to stay. (****)",10/10,14 July 2023,lugonian,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Best Movie Ever Made,"I'm a movie buff,so there are several favorites on my list but if a number one choice must be made then hands down it would be ""Gone With The Wind"" was, is, and will always be the best movie ever made. Ever since its premiere in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" was ahead of it's time and set the bar for all motion pictures after it. There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement. Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.

Every time I watch this film,and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.

Footnote: I really enjoyed the sequel called ""Scarlett"" especially the climax. My sister encouraged me to watch but silly as it may seem I felt a sequel to this masterpiece was sacrilegious.",10/10,28 June 2015,magical-kingdom,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Probably the best film ever,"This film is probably one of the most remarkable in the history of cinema. A film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. It won eight Oscars (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography Color, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Leading Actress, Best Supporting Actress - for the first time given to a black actress - and even two special statuettes for RD Musgrave and William Cameron Menzies, for technical achievements) and was nominated for five more. Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.

The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.

Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley.

Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.

For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever. For me, its also the best movie ever, despite the many other great films that followed, through the decades.",10/10,25 June 2016,filipemanuelneto,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
The Power and the Glory of Vivien Leigh,"Any number of minor aspects of this 1939 release may seem ""dated"" by today's standards. But not Selznick's terrific sense of drama and certainly not Vivien Leigh's performance. Which seems eternally fresh, surprising, rich and compelling. One of the best times I ever had watching this movie was several years back when it was given a wide re-release and playing at a neighborhood theater on New York's west side. It was a midweek afternoon and a number of African-American schoolgirls had elected to play hooky and see it. They were completely enthralled, and the reason why was Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara. They were impulsive teenagers, and so was she. In fact Scarlet might best be described as the most formidable impulsive teenager of all time. Can't really be sure how much of the rest of the film got through to these girls, but they cheered Leigh on for whatever it was she wanted to do. And who can blame them?

One of the only things i can think about it is how extremely long it is! if this movie had been half the time it actually is it probably wouldve been an amazing movie in my opinion! but the length destroys the whole movie! This movie is really not that interesting, with the exception of a very few scenes through it's runtime. It is impressing for its time, that was about the only thing i thought was really strong with this movie. I think this movie is very overappreciated, and trust me, i have done my fair share to understand the love for this movie, but the only thing i can do is to respect the movie, but only because, as i said earlier, it was impressive for it's time. Clark Gable's performance was also something that made this movie a little better, but it was not really anything special with the performance.

Great movie. Campy. 1939. Fiction. Not a documentary.,"It's not a documentary. It's a campy great classic movie filmed in the 30's. It's fiction. No reason for all this.

Terrible what the Academy Awards did to Hattie McDaniel.

"This movie is about the Old South was brought to an end by the Civil War. It included aspects of romance, jealousy, and comedy to depict the effects of the Civil War.","""Gone with the Wind"" has incorporated aspects of romance, drama, and comedy meanwhile portraying the events of the Civil War. However at certain parts of the movie, it was slow and mundane. The love triangle between Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley Wilkes intensifies as the movie progresses. Scarlett marries three men, ending with Rhett Butler. Throughout those marriages, she truly loves Ashley Wilkes and is jealous of Ashley's cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is his wife. At the end of the film, Scarlett realizes the mistake of loving another man but Rhett leaves to go back to Charleston. Comedy is a recurring aspect in the movie. Mammy, who is a slave for the O'Hara family, makes remarks about Scarlett which provides the viewer to be more engaged in the movie. The death of Bonnie Blue was sad, depressing, and made Scarlett and Rhett grow further apart. Rhett claimed that the only thing that was keeping their marriage alive was Bonnie because Scarlett loved Ashley Wilkes.

Probably the most overrated film in history,"I gave this film 1/10; I would have scored it a perfect 0 if there was the option. I'm probably doing the film a disservice given that much, much worse films have been made. A true reflection of this film would probably be somewhere closer to 4, but I feel an obligation to counterbalance the thousands of perfect 10 scores from people who regard this as a ""timeless classic."" Anyone who considers Gone With the Wind a timeless classic should ignore the fact the it's an old film highly rated by emperor's-new-clothes types and ask themselves what they would think of a modern equivalent: an extraordinarily overlong film with a meandering, muddled storyline punctuated with cheesy dialog and hammy acting and done on an ""epic"" scale because the budget allows it (It's starting to sound like Titanic! Another zero).

The brilliant Vivien Leigh made me so angry!!,"Just yesterday, I watched the entire GWTW for the first time (excellent quality DVD)and even though in comfort of my own home, I found this film way too long. I would not, could not, sit for almost four hours in a cinema to watch any movie. As a great number of reviewers have pointed out here, this is a movie of two parts, the second bordered on soap opera and partly for that reason, I am unable to give a 10 star, gushing endorsement to GWTW.

The characterisation also bothered me. Of the four principal parts, Leslie Howard's (Ashley Wilkes)was the least credible performance.Here we have someone ready and eager to go off to war but someone unable or unwilling to express his genuine love for his wife Melanie when taunted by the scheming, jealous Scarlett O'Hara. And it seems so odd that Selznick would cast an Englishman as a southern gentleman, particularly when Howard's 'Englishness' was so apparent for his entire performance?! Surely there were better-looking US actors (who sounded like southerners) to play the part of a so-called dashing lead character!

Despite the fact that it was apparent that everybody regarded Melanie(Olivia De Havilland) as a saintly figure who never spoke ill of anybody, it was almost beyond credibility that she appeared so blithely unaware of Scarlett's manipulative, brattish intentions and behaviour. And on learning of the possible romantic link between Ashley and Scarlett, Melanie reacts in an even more incredible fashion.

It was the portrayal, the brilliant portrayal by Vivien Leigh of the story's heroine, that unnerved me more than anything else. Despite the many reasonable defences of Scarlett's character and behaviour - she shows stoicism in hardship, displays admirable strength in returning the fortunes of Tara etc etc - I found Scarlett O'Hara such a most unlikeable, indeed, almost detestable character, that I longed for the scene in which she would get her comeuppance! She was selfish (selfless when material gain beckoned), simpering, headstrong, jealous, vindictive, childish, scheming, stubborn, cruel and seemingly incapable of genuine affection for anybody save her father - most noticeably not for any of her three husbands nor for the presumed object of her unrequited love, Ashley Wilkes. She even steals her younger sister's fiancé Frank Kennedy whom she marries for financial gain. Scarlett also shows no qualms in engaging in dubious business practices and exploiting convict labour in her lumber business.

How typical that shortly after marriage, Rhett insists he'll spend as much as necessary on a new mansion in Atlanta and Scarlett responds with: ""Oh Rhett, I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.""

On three occasions, Scarlett uses physical force to show her anger and pride when she slaps somebody across the face - if only Ashley or Rhett or even Mammy had the gumption to give this hoyden a similar whack!

From my perspective, never has there been a more apt closing line in a movie because regarding the fate of Scarlett O'Hara, I couldn't give a damn.

All Time Best Movie Heads South,"For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera.",10/10,21 July 2006,vitaleralphlouis,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"Frankly, Scarlett -- He DID give a damn ...","GONE WITH THE WIND, MGM, 1939 IMG_1251.JPG IMG_1251.JPG GONE With The Wind"" is so famous, probably the most famous motion picture of all time, that the initials alone GWTW are enough to identify it, yet, how many people alive today have ever seen it, not chopped up on the boob tube, but uncxut on a full size screen — undoubtedly very few. One of the most rewarding side bars of this years 65th Berlin Film Festival was the restored Technicolor Section in cooperation with MoMA of New York City, and the Eastman Kodak Archive in Rochester, N.Y. Among the many choice offerings a totally restored print, fifteen minute musical preamble and all, with 15 minute intermission at the halfway mark, of ""Gone With The Wind"", the magnificent silver screen wonder of 1939 ~1940. I had seen it so long ago that I needed a refresher on the plot — Scarlett such a scheming bitch and Gable such a cool cad, Both negative characters you can't help being charmed by and rooting for both even through they are pitted against each other in a towering knock-down drag-out love-hate relationship. I had forgotten that Gable actually marries Leigh and they have a child together who gets killed in a horse jumping accident before their horrified eyes. Of course everyone remembers Gable's famous last line: ""Frankly Scarlet — I don't givva Damn! """" – but how many can recall the context? ~ It was in reply to Scarlett pleading with him not to leave her, after giving him nothing but heartache and two-timings all along — claiming that now at Long Last with the death of their child she realizes that she really loves Him — (Not wimpy high-minded Ashley Wilkes) — and exclaims pitifully as he is about to walk off: ""What will I do with out you!!"" — to which GABLE's memorable last line finally puts her in her place. It is well worth noting that in 1939 ""Damn"" was regarded as a such a strong expletive that It barely got past the damn Puritannical censors of the time! ~~ Today he could say: I don't give a flying f**k"" – and in our oversaturated four letter word world it wouldn't be half as shocking.

A marvelous experience to see Gone With The Wind in all its blazing glory here in Berlin. But, what struck me Most about It in retrospect was how similar the central love triangle between Gable, Vivian Leigh (The all time most beautiful and alluring silver screen bitch!)– and Leslie Howard, was — nearly a perfect parallel to: Bogart, Bergman, and Paul Henreid, in CASABLANCA — So similar, in fact, that one can't help thinking that the writers of Casablanca were simply reapplying a tried and true box-office formula just three years later, updated, of course, from the Civil War to World War II then raging in North Africa. With uncanny serendipity, only weeks after the premiere of Casablanca the big three allied leaders, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin met at Casablanca to decide the postwar fate of Europe.

Come to think of It Gable as Bogart, Vivian Leigh As Bergman, and Howard as wimpy high Minded Hero Victor Laszlo, would have been almost as good a cast for the B/W Curtiz pop Masterpiece. Curiously enough actor Leslie Howard was Shot down by the Nazis on a flight from Gibraltar not far from Casablanca which was thought to be carrying Winston Churchill in June 1943 — just as the film Casablanca was becoming the box office sensation of the year back in the states.

Can anyone believe this movie was made on the 30???,"It is complex write anything about ""Gone With the Wind"" because I have the impression that everything or almost everything has been said about this work that remains current and exciting after 76 years. ""Gone With the Wind"" is far from being an art film, but this fact does not diminish its greatness. ""Gone With the Wind"" is a prime example of that commercial films can be very good and well made. Commercial films do not necessarily need to be based on cliché's and conventional or happy endings. It can be said that the film was bold by the standards of the time, to invest in a young, brave and stubborn girl, however, full of flaws like any real person. Scarlett drinks, flirts a married man, eat too much in public, negotiates with enemies, collects the debts of friends, accepted dance despite being in mourning, finally defies all moral severely respected by the society to which it belongs. But it does not get to indulge with the transgression. Quite the opposite. Deep down, she is a moralist who lived intensely admires the straight and values taught by her mother. She transgresses to survive and to enforce their will. She transgresses to keep the land left by parents who for her, symbolically, it was the parents themselves. To Scarlett, violate or transgress not is not the issue. The question is to survive. Scarlett is a survivor of war, hunger, poverty, the tragic loss of their parents, a never materialized love. Although, it is seen as a great heroine for his tireless ability to fight, Scarlett in a way, it is a loser. As the character of Clark Gable said, she throws out happiness with both hands. ""Gone With the Wind"" is much more than an epic; It is much more than a movie about the war and its consequences; is a film about determination and survival figures incarnated on earth image. Another factor that deserves special attention is the character Melanie. We are not sure to what extent she knows the real feelings and personality of Scarlett, which is a very interesting open issue. A memorable soundtrack! A 5 stars classic. I know a person that watch this movie 5 times!!!!

A True Classic,"A movie should not be judged purely on its level of writing skill and overall deftness. For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.

That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.

Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.

But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go.

There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).

Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, ""Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""

The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man.

Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it.

But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.

Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.

So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day.",10/10,24 September 2015,joshuafagan-64214,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Victor Fleming and Other Directors of The Wind!,"""Gone With The Wind"" won numerous awards, including the Photoplay Gold Medal and the Film Daily Best Picture of the Year (selected by polling over 450 U.S. film critics), but missed out on The New Film Critics (though Vivien Leigh's was voted Best Feminine Performance) which went to Wuthering Heights. The National Board of Review placed Gone With The Wind only 9th (even The Biscuit Eater preceded it).

The uncredited writers listed by IMDb all made a fair contribution to the finished script. Other writers who worked on the scenario at various stages include Jo Swerling, John Balderston, Michael Foster, Winston Miller, Charles MacArthur and Edwin Justus Mayer. Director George Cukor also took a hand.

The story of the filming of ""Gone With The Wind"" has been told in many books, most notably ""Scarlet, Rhett, and a Cast of Thousands"" by Roland Flamini (Macmillan, New York, 1975).

The director: Considering the continued popularity of at least three of his films, Victor Fleming has never been a household name. Yet more people have seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in a cinema than any other movie in history. In 1982, gross film rental to that date from the U.S.- Canada market alone was $76,700,000. (Negative cost: $3,957,000). As some movie prices have increased a staggering 5,000% since 1939, the figure needs to be multiplied by at least ten — perhaps as much as twenty or thirty — to give a just comparison with movies such as Star Wars ($193,500,000) and E.T. ($187,000,000). ""Gone With The Wind"" was voted the best film of all time in a poll conducted by the American Film Institute. But not only did Fleming direct this outright winner, he had another film among the nine runners-up: ""The Wizard of Oz"". Fleming was the only director with two films on the list.

Some critics have pointed out that Fleming did not direct all of either of these films. He had to leave ""Wizard"" for ""Wind"" when the former picture was almost completed. King Vidor finished up. However, Fleming returned after his stint on GWTW to supervise the cutting of Oz and it would be churlish indeed to cavil at his sole director credit. GWTW is a bit different. Cukor had already directed about 5% of the finished movie when Fleming took over. When Victor himself walked out after a particularly acrimonious clash with Vivien Leigh, Sam Wood was called in and then retained to direct a second unit, even after Fleming was prevailed upon to return. Wood directed 33 minutes (14%) of the released footage, particularly in the Reconstruction sequences.

William Cameron Menzies directed about 15% of the picture, including the Atlanta fire (the first scene shot) and the memorable silhouette of Leigh and Mitchell at Tara. However, Fleming directed all Gable's scenes (except Rhett's visit to Scarlett with the Paris hat, which was directed by Cukor; and Gable's final exit, which was actually directed by Selznick himself — in Fleming's presence). Fleming also shot the opening sequence of the picture at Tara, Ashley's furlough, Leigh and Howard's love scene in the woodshed, Melanie's death, some of Scarlett's return to Tara, some of the scenes in the cotton fields, and perhaps the film's most memorable shot of all — the enormous crane shot of wounded Confederate soldiers at the railroad depot. (Selznick himself directed some of these takes, and in the end, neither man could say who shot the take actually used in the movie).

The film's most memorable scene — Scarlett shooting Paul Hurst's deserter — was directed by Cukor.

It might justly be claimed that as Fleming directed the main story- line, he deserved the main credit. All the same he was unhappy at being shut out of the film's editing by Selznick. He boycotted the Awards dinner at the Ambassador at which he would have received his first — and only — honor from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. (He'd never been nominated before and was never nominated again.)

"""A civilization gone with the wind...""","In my opinion this is a movie that has them all, a movie that will remain without an equal, even if a lot of time passed since its release.

This happened because of the period when the movie was made and shown to the public, an era in which a conservative society was yet far from the atrocities of WW2 and all the new ideas that spread before its end.

Is a movie with great pictures, great images, color-full, pictorial while portraying an almost Utopia world, yet an idyllic one, where all the things were settled, time was passing by so slowly and so calm with all the people living and breathing their lives in a breeze of peace.

Is a story like no other about the Old South, a story about a certain vision about the world, a vision we may applaud or condemn but nevertheless we should see and understand and we must be glad that we can observe from a distance another vision about living, about society, about human relationships, about master, servants and what can become of them.",No rating,4 November 2016,singureanu_andrei,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
Beautiful but ignorant,"In terms of drama and romance this movie is sort of a masterpiece but from a historical standpoint and considering the ignorant tone regarding the well-known social issues of that time, it's kina tasteless. It glorifies the southern army and depicts only caricatures of black servants. IMHO a movie whitewashing such serious issues shouldn't be considered as one of the greatest movies of all time no matter how high the production quality. So in a sense similar to Scarlett, the movie is beautiful to watch but ignorant about some important matters.

"Dated, Long, And Controversial? Sure. But It's A Masterpiece Of Cinematic Storytelling Nonetheless.","I'm a film buff and I love classic movies. As such, Gone With The Wind is in my Top 15 favorite movies. I first saw it when I was 11, and I've seen it about 7 or 8 times from start to finish in the last 13 years. It's a bit dated and controversial today, 84 years after its release, but I still think it's a masterpiece, nonetheless.

Gone With The Wind follows Scarlett O'Hara, played by Viven Leigh. She's the spoiled daughter of a plantation owner named Gerald, played by Thomas Mitchell. (He later played Uncle Billy in It's A Wonderful Life.)

Scarlett is in love with the dashing Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). However, he is in love with her best friend, Melanie (Olivia De Havilland). In an attempt to make him jealous, she marries 3 times (the first 2 husbands pass away), and her 3rd husband- Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) makes her feelings all the more complex.

Gone With The Wind is a grand film on many levels. All the actors, including the ones named, all do superb work in their roles.

This includes Cammie King, who plays Scarlett and Rhett's daughter Bonnie, and who later voiced young Faline in Bambi, and Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African American to win an Oscar for her role, as the house slave Mammie.

Fun Fact: Hattie mostly played maids and slaves in her films, and someone asked her if this offended her. She famously replied: ""I'd rather play a maid for $700 a week than be one for $7."" It is sad that she was just seen as good for maid roles in films, however she had an excellent attitude about it.

The movie is also beautifully shot, and the cinematography is glorious and not at all dated for a movie that is over 8 decades old. On that note, Gone With The Wind is one of the earliest examples of movies in color, the majority of movies were in black and white then.

Gone With The Wind also has many great famous lines, such as ""Tomorow is another day"" and the immortal ""Frankly My Dear"" line from Rhett.

Also, while the movie runs for nearly 4 HOURS, every minute is worth it, and that alone makes it a masterpiece.

That said, I should address the elephant in the room, that being the modern controversy of how Gone With The Wind...kind of glorifies slavery.

In the movie, most slaves happily sing and serve their masters. In one scene, some slaves go off to fight in the Civil War to stay slaves. (This is historically accurate, but awkward to watch in 2023.)

Then there's some stereotypical African American talk, like: ""Get up in he-uh!"" and ""Massa"" and ""Mm-mm-mm!""

I can't, and won't, say that's good, and I will say some of this makes me cringe that this was allowed in 1939. However, you do have to consider that this was post-slavery and pre-segregation, so sadly America did not properly portray African Americans.

That said, there are far more controversial portrayals out there- for example, The Jazz Singer, the first talkie, and Holiday Inn, a classic Christmas movie, both include scenes with blackface. Gone With The Wind is showing history, and that's something we should learn from, not cancel.

I should admit, I am a white man, so maybe I would feel slightly different if I were African American, but again, Gone With The Wind is still portraying the mid-1800s in the American South, and it's simply doing so accurately.

Also, not all the slavery stuff is ""glorified."" In one scene, a slave named Prissy (played by Butterfly McQueen) tells Scarlett she can help deliver Melanie's first baby, she's ""done it lots and lots.""

She later admits that she lied and has no experience whatsoever. Scarlett gets so angry that Prissy lied to her that she punches her in the face. Not just slap, she POWS her fist right in Prissy's cheek.

This is a very shocking scene, and even when I was 11, it made my head shake back. I'd be surprised if anyone ever approved of that scene, it was clearly supposed to be a horrible thing for Scarlett to do that, slave or no slave.

Gone With The Wind may have some cringy bits when it comes to the slave scenes, but it's not even really a movie about slavery. It's about the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, and I think most people today forget about that. It's a romance film, not a slavery film. There's not even a slave on the cover art, it's just Rhett and Scarlett in the center.

Also, considering Hattie McDaniel's attitude and award, I think Gone With The Wind deserves much more praise than backlash on that alone!

Finally, it IS a little dated and long, but frankly my dear, I don't give a d*mn about that. Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, and film buffs and casual viewers alike should see it. It's one of the greatest movies ever made, despite what you hear against it today.

If you can't watch it today, then watch it tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.

Bonus Fun Fact: This was the first movie that Turner Classic Movies (TCM) ever aired- on April 14th, 1994. As such, they often play it on April 14th in honor of TCM's anniversary.

"Great art + hateful characters = 65 years of debate, influence, misunderstanding and admiration","Finally, seeing the film the way it was meant to be seen (in the newly released and restored, theatrical-ratio, letter-boxed format, digital transfer 4-disc DVD set, {phew!}) showed me more than I bargained for. ""Gone with the Wind"" has been (immediately following its 1939 release) hailed as a classic. And it does have all the makings of a classic: Sprawling sets, beautiful cinematography, amazing music, brilliant directing and the desire of two studios working together to get the job done properly. No expense was spared (and it shows) in the making of the film, and the audience was given a true visual treat. The script was fine, as most of the dialog was verbatim from Margaret Mitchell's novel, and the actors read their lines and performed their scenes to the best of their ability (some obviously better than others). Unfortunately, the problems with the picture far out weigh the positives and it was the same problems that the novel had. The characters that these wonderful to mediocre actors play are despicable. The lot of them. Scarlett is the most hateful female character I have encountered, ever. She is petty, selfish, dishonest, she puts on airs even when she has no reason to, she is unfaithful to her family (marrying her sister's romantic interest - even if it was to save the estate), she is manipulative and generally just an out and out witch (choice of first letter optional). Likewise, and making the perfect couple from Hell, Rhett is a scoundrel; an abuser, a womanizer, a drunk and would turn sides against the North or the South or his own mother if it were to raise his bank account. Ashley is horrid; he is wishy-washy (especially for a soldier), unfaithful to his wife - who is also his cousin (if not in body, most certainly in mind), weak-willed and idiotic in his decision to go to Atlanta instead of New York (away from the evil and manipulative Scarlett). Even Melanie is unlikable; at the very least because of the blind faith she places in her husband and the unwarranted, misplaced trust she places in Scarlett, if not for the incestuous relationship with Ashley. And those are just the leads! The secondary characters are no better. Mammy is arrogant and often unnecessarily angry; Prissy is a liar and a dolt; Ellen O'Hara (Scarlett's mother) is cold, bitter, distant and unpleasant, Gerald O'Hara (the father) is stubborn and rigid, and later weak and detached. In fact the only truly pleasant characters are Big Sam who saves Scarlett from attackers (much to this viewer's disappointment) and the prostitute-with-the-heart-of-gold who gives Melanie money for the hospital and later safe-houses Ashley for Rhett. And all of the above (well, except maybe Mammy, Prissy and Big Sam) are all in support of the Old South. If these characters are not hateful for the above reasons given (which they are - at least by yours truly) then they must be condemned simply for holding dearly a philosophy which, not only accepted, but championed slavery, incest and war and put more stock in keeping up appearances as opposed to accepting reality. I am not hater of great art, and I know a good movie when I see it. I loved this film for the cinematic genius that it must have taken to produce it. But watching loathsome people for nearly four hours is a bit hard to stomach, regardless of the ingenuity and obvious skill provided on-set and behind the scenes. In other classic films like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"" (and more recently with ""Falling Down"", ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Pulp Fiction""), the audience is able to enjoy the viewing experience because even though the main protagonist is disliked, dreaded or despised, at least they remain sympathetic. I did not feel sorry for one character at one time during ""Gone with the Wind"". They all got what they deserved. Even Bonnie is better off dead than have to live with the soul-sucking Scarlett as her mother. So, my final review: 10 stars out of 10 for production, direction, cinematography, musical composition and performance and faithful adaptation of the novel; 8 out of 10 stars for acting (brought up 2 whole points - one each for Clark Gable and Olivia de Havilland, both of whom were remarkable, regardless of their awful characters); 2 out of 10 stars for the characters and story (these are terrible people from head to toe, from page to screen; people whom you would walk across the street to spit on, but a 1 out of 10 stars is a score reserved for films like ""Glitter"", ""Crossroads"" and ""You Got Served""); and my overall score (10+8+2 divided by 3) is 6.7 stars out of 10. This film is obviously worth seeing and (this new version is) probably worth owning, but worth loving? I'm not so sure.

Gone with the Wind was a bad movie!,"Wow. This was a bad movie. I can't believe this is one of the ""best"" movies of all time. I always had my reservations about David O. Selznick and now that I have seen his epic ""masterpiece,"" I can see his fingerprints all over Rebecca. I am a huge fan of Hitchcock and always wondered how much he was overruled in the making of that film. I will wonder no more. I can't imagine why anyone would like this melodrama. I laughed more than I have at some comedies. I could not keep a straight face as the movie Scarlett argued with Mammy to make her green velvet dress. I was taken back to Carol Burnett's fantastic portrayal of Scarlett walking down the stairs with a curtain rod stuck in her dress. I can't say much for the acting, Leigh and Gable left much to be desired. Hattie McDaniel was great, besides the other African Americans that made up the cast, that was it. The only good thing about this movie was that it gave African Americans speaking parts and was one of the only post code films in the late 30's the 40's and much of the 50's that was shown in the South that gave African Americans speaking parts and showed them in the movie. Many films of this time did not. I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE!",1/10,4 January 2008,BusGrat,Gone with the Wind (1939),NEGATIVE
The Great American Movie,"So it's about time I finally got around to reviewing the big cheese itself, the towering achievement of American cinema, those four glorious syllables - Gone With The Wind.

Gone With The Wind testament to how much filmmaking had changed in just 10 years from the beginning of the talkie period. From the astounding cinematic shots such as the long take of the bodies of fallen soldiers lying in the streets of Atlanta to those red Technicolor skies which I could stare at all day to the huge matte paintings which are hard to distinguish from real sets - it's a world to get lost in (I can even ignore the very clear continuity error at the beginning of the film in which it goes from dusk back to early evening to dusk again). Even those opening titles themselves are breathtaking, let alone for a time when opening titles where comprised of basic on-screen title cards.

Gone With The Wind is a film with a fascinating history as it's backdrop. The pink elephant in the room however for many modern viewers is the troublesome historical image of the American South both pre and post-antebellum, whether just or unjust. The emphasis on the Wilkes family marrying their cousins doesn't help things but the real but the real point of contention is the dreaded ""R"" word, racism. To dismiss Gone With the Wind as a racist film is such a reductive argument, especially when certain commentators liken it to The Birth of a Nation, a film which shows black members in the House of Representatives eating fried chicken. To actually watch Gone With The Wind and study it closely, the way the film examines the racial issues is more 3 dimensional than popular critique contends.

Gone With The Wind is told from the point of view of slave owners who don't see anything wrong with owning slaves (nor is it ever made clear if the plantation owners start paying their former slaves following the end of the Civil War). The slave owners are a product of their time which the movie doesn't pass judgment on. Only one line of dialogue in the film deals with the question of morality when it comes to slavery in which Ashley responds to Scarlett's use of prisoners for labour which implies Ashley sees nothing wrong with slavery providing the slaves are treated well; ""Scarlett, I will not make money out of the enforced labour and misery of others"" ""You won't so particular about owning slaves"" ""That was different; we didn't treat them that way""

I find by far the most interesting aspect of race portrayed in Gone With The Wind is the stark contrast between the black carpetbaggers (northerners who came to the south following the war who were perceived to be exploiting the local populace) and the recently freed slaves who are still childlike, dim-witted and happy to help out their masters of whom they are dependent on. The first black carpetbagger seen in the film is a sharply dressed, liberated northern black man traveling with a white accomplice but more significantly, in a scene not long after this Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) sneers at a pair of African-American carpetbaggers who are wearing fancy suits, smoking cigars and laughing. Mammy, who just had to beg for money along with Scarlett, looks down upon these black men having the time of their lives. While the phrase is not used in the movie, these individuals would be referred to in many quarters as ""Uncle Toms"", perceived sellouts to their black brethren. The appearance of independent, well to do black men from the North goes against the narrative of Gone With The Wind being a racist film. I'm not qualified to comment on the historical accuracy of Gone With the Wind or how well it portrayed the time and place it depicts but there's too much nuance within the film's depiction to simply shout ""wasis!"" rather than having a more productive conversation or what the film did or did not do right. To quote the late, great Roger Ebert, ""A politically correct ""GWTW"" would not be worth making, and might largely be a lie.""

The film's opening prologue and the scenic shots of Tara could be seen as Confederate propaganda with its Utopian presentation of a world alongside the opening prologue which reads; ""There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind.""

Yet if there's any authorial or filmmaking intent to propagate Confederate lost cause mythology (historical revisionism that the Confederacy's cause during the civil war was a just and heroic one) it is countered by much of the film's content. There's no explicit condemnation of slavery or the confederacy but does the movie have to do this? The biggest so called Uncle Tom in Gone With The Wind is Scarlet O'Hara herself for doing business with the northern carpetbaggers in order to save Tara and rise above poverty. What makes Scarlett O'Hara a character I can empathize with? By many accounts, I shouldn't as she's bratty, entitled and manipulative, yet you can't help but admire her desire to survive and make better of herself despite what onlookers might say (her gumption as Margret Mitchell describes it). Scarlet is shown to have little interest in the southern cause (as does Rhett Butler). This is memorably symbolized in the shot in which war has just been announced as everyone runs frantically through the foyer of Twelve Oaks and Scarlett angrily walks by them as if they aren't even there. Really the one cause Scarlett is dedicated to is that set of her family of Irish immigrants who came to America and accomplished the American Dream of owning land (""Land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for"").

Then there's my boy, Rhett Butler; the cinematic embodiment alongside Han Solo and Indiana Jones of masculinity and individualism (and what an introductory shot!). Men want to be him and women want to be with him. A man out for himself and a realist doesn't really believe in the Confederate cause and is by far the most self-aware character in the film. In a defining scene Rhett points out how the south isn't equipped for war while the other southern gentlemen are blinded by illusions of grandeur and he's not afraid to call them out on it, while remaining a gentleman the whole time and even removes himself from the meeting after the other gentlemen feel insulted by his comments. Even when Rhett joins the Confederate Army near the end of the war as he describes himself as having a weakness for lost causes, he's still self-aware of how foolish his actions are. Just before Rhett leaves Scarlet at the carriage after escaping from a burning Atlanta, the film treats us to what I consider the greatest kiss in film history with its layers on intensity; melodramatic dialogue, sweeping music, and the blood-red sky.

Rhett's actions do however lead to one scene which gets many viewers in a tussle; Rhett's drunken marital rape of Scarlett after she refuses to have sex with him (not to mention Scarlett is seen the following the morning have enjoyed the experience!) I don't believe however the film at all rewards or gratifies Rhett for his actions and subtlety condemns it. Not only does Rhett show remorse for his actions the following morning, but the rape is also the final act which leads to the destruction of a marriage which was already on shaky ground.

Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes on-the-other-hand is in many ways the counterpoint of Rhett Butler as the tender, effeminate, proud southerner (with a transatlantic accent, go figure). Ashley is a romantic who is crippled by his nostalgia for the old south. Ashley spends most of the film listlessly adrift through the harsher realities of the reconstruction era. Unlike Scarlett, he has no goals or ambitions for the future. All he can do is remember the elegance of his life as it once was and wish that he could return to those old days. Rounding out the film's four main cast members is Olivia de Havilland in her undersung performance as Melanie Wilkes, crossing the line of being saintly without ever being sickly. Did she know about Scarlett and Ashley or not? Was she really a saint, or just naive, or perhaps exceptionally wise? Perhaps Melanie knew she could trust Ashley while seeing that Rhett was the right man for Scarlett by trying to promote their relationship. Scarlet is the sister Melanie always wanted with each of them possessing qualities the other lacked, especially during their bond over joint survival during and after the war. Scarlett saved Melanie's life and Melanie kept her cool under fire in a way that earned Scarlett's private (though reluctant) admiration. She also did not hesitate to do hard work she never would have had to touch before the war. She was, therefore, more valuable to the family's survival than Scarlett's two sisters. Now if only I could do without Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), one of the most cowardly, unlikeable characters ever - and that nails on chalkboard voice! Thankfully Scarlett gives her a good slap! Gone With The Wind is one of few films in which every character, no matter how minor is significant in their own way, with Star Wars or The Ten Commandments being one of few other films which achieve this.

Love in troubled times,"Sometimes love needs to be held on and beaten, but once love has bound the wings of the lover, please let it go as soon as possible.

Scarlett, do you think it's worth hurting someone who loves you for someone who has hurt you before? Vanity is a part of all human beings, but it's important to get out of it and not wait for what you really need to lose before you can appreciate it. So always ask yourself: are you doing what you really need right now? You are successful, but do you consider yourself happy? Rhett, I think you've done all you have to do. Including the dedication to the cause, the ""implicit"" loyalty to the south, the unswerving pursuit of lovers, the meticulous love of the daughter. Though you knew that the south had lost the battle before it was fought, and though you and most southerners could not appear to share in it, you fought for the south everywhere during the war. You fought with millions of southerners, and when the battle was won, you left your loved ones behind and joined the confederate army. For the love, for the daughter, changed a man, a father can change everything.

You're a shrewd businessman, but you can't calculate your feelings. I think this you know, feelings sometimes need to be confused, so you rarely care about scarlett, everything for the sake of the girl. And once the daughter died, all the sustenance and hope also die. At this time you have nearly collapsed, is mei lanli, the woman you admire most, let you walk out of the bedroom again, to life. But when you know that the woman who gave everything for it has never loved you, but still loves ASHLEY, and married herself only for the poor three hundred dollars. You may be unbearable, so choose to leave, leave that only sad and tragic place, leave that will only make their own shame and pain scarlett.

However, leaving will only let you get a temporary adjustment and comfort, not for a long time joy and happiness, because after all you still like, love scarlett, leaving her will only be painful, not happy. It is better to get back together and create happiness for both of us than to cause pain for both of us if one of us leaves. Scarlett has completely come to her senses, so give her another chance, and also give yourself another chance to be happy, and go back to tara and scarlett again! After all, tomorrow is another day. Mei lanli, ""exhaling such as LAN, xinfang such as hui"" so describe you again appropriate however. You have the noblest character in the human race -- kindness, the most appealing quality in a man -- tenderness. You are wise and virtuous, know how to write, gentle and kind... You possess almost all the good qualities of man, so that my clumsy pen cannot describe them. But ASHLEY doesn't really love you. But...

ASHLEY, you may be a gentleman, your noble temperament attracted many obsessed with fantasy girls, including scarlett, I do not know what thing is your body captured scarlett's soul. Let's not say your marriage and mei lanli is happy, you and the feelings between mei lanli is not love. Perhaps you have only one kind of dependence and sustenance on mei LAN li. But as a man should never take life on others like you, especially on a woman (no matter how good she is), can't say you have no definite view, but you are weak, you are too too complacent, so that lose the power to change the status quo, the satisfaction of the abnormal gradually eroding your desire to do better. If you want to achieve anything, you must be independent, especially in spirit. If you want to make progress, you must have an endless stream of new goals, and work hard for them. You must be strong. Tragedy happens because of human nature.

""Gone with the wind"" is the youth of scarlett's generation, the kind of picnic and dance life; It is the ""ideal"" of the southern plantation-style aristocracy, and the arrogant, blind and ignorant southerners. Is that unforgettable love, is all the unfortunate past.

The power of a classic is that it moves people.

Gone With the Wind,"This is by far one of the best movies ever made in American film history. It is great in every way a film can be great. With me being a history major, particularly interested in the Civil War, this film really does it for me. The tough part of the film for many is how it starts. It starts out during a time period where slavery was legal and the plantations where plentiful in the south. People were pretty naive that were part of the privilege and the rich class. Historians have had a problem for years with the beginning half of the movie because to a extent it glorifies the life of the southern from the plantation owners to the slaves even being somewhat grateful and dependant on their owners. This film shows show this very much. But the film is more then that. It illustrates the horrors of the war. People fighting in the war and the effects it has on the families involved. So many people lose their loved ones and end up in property, forever changing the south. This is definitely a classic.

"An incredible film, even after many decades","An incredible film, even after many decades. It has lost nothing of its tension, has lost nothing of its visual power. A template for every cinematic family epic. Deep and poignant on many levels.

The pictures are simply incredible for their time. The visual splendor of the film is breathtaking. From the expansive Southern landscapes to the opulent costumes and sets, the viewer is transported to a bygone era, brought to life by the masterful cinematography and impressive production design.

In addition to its aesthetic brilliance, the film also deals with themes such as racism, class differences and the consequences of war, making it a captivating and profound work at the same time. Despite its epic length of over four hours, ""Gone With the Wind"" never loses momentum or relevance. Each scene is carefully staged and contributes to the overall effect of the film.

Clark Gable as Rhett Butler is the perfect complement to Leigh's Scarlett. His charisma and masculine presence give the character of Rhett an unparalleled depth and complexity. The chemistry between Leigh and Gable is electric and contributes significantly to the success of the film.

Unfortunately lost on today's dumbed-down pop/hiphop culture,"And that is truly a shame. Fans of revisionist history should stay away. You'll only be offended by the somewhat historically accurate and faithful adaptation of a time and culture you don't understand, and haven't been affected by. The only issue I have with this film is the portrayal of post war reconstruction with all the central figures of the story emerging after the war as prosperous businessmen-please! But then again that's not what Hollywood's all about,is it? Still a very powerful and relevant film. And while I'll admit that Miss Scarlet is a completely despicable character, no one can question her strength and spirit as she grows from spoiled a and sheltered socialite, to survivor, warrior, and cold hearted mercenary. A great film with only a few minor faults 10/10.

Glorious and tragic drama!,"I first saw this picture in 1961 on the big screen when I was 14. I thought it was a 10 then and I think its a 10 today. The book was written by a woman ( Margaret Mitchell) and its a women's picture. The three best characters are #1 ""Scarlett O' Hara"" played extremely well by Vivien Leigh. Who could play her better? Her beautiful and expressive cat like face expressing joy, childishness, flirtatiousness, jealousy, anguish and hardness. But her character makes a lot of mistakes, chiefly thinking she loved Ashley when she really loved Rhett. I like to think they eventually got back together.

#2 Then there's ""Melanie Wilkes"" played beautifully by Olivia D'Havilland. Melanie is frail physically but she is strong because she loves with wisdom and altruism.

#3 And Mammy. She is strong and wise and very moral. She scolds Scarlett many times and Rhett a few times. She was given a lot of great lines. GWTW is often criticized for being racist, but would the writers have given her so many great lines if they were racist? IIRC, the book gave her a lot of great lines. Pork and Prissy have some good lines too!

And of course, the men. ""Rhett Butler"" played so well by Clark Gable. Could any one else have played him?? I do think they could have found someone better ( younger) for Ashley Wilkes. But Leslie Howard did a decent job. Thomas Mitchell as Pa was excellent! When I was young I had a crush on Clark Gable. Now that I'm older I'm crushing on Thomas Mitchell (LOL)

The music was excellent! Always appropriate and never overwhelming.

And of course the cinematography... Excellent.

Dialogue great. When I watch, I enjoy the lines again and again!

Best movie ever made!

The Best Motion Picture of the 20th Century,"Easily the best film ever made, even in today's standards it holds up, beautifully shot, acted to a T, it has the best performance coming from Ms. Vivien Leigh, a true triumph. Some of the most commonly used lines used today come from this film, and also some of the most memorable lines, I mean who doesn't know the line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" very taboo for that time... I mean come on, give me any movie and I will show you in every way this film is better and highly superio, the only films I could think that would come close would be Evita, On Golden Pond, and West Side Story.

"Flawed, dated, but a classic nonetheless!","1 - I didn't see anyhting wrong with it. Politically correct has gone to the extreme. I have my ideals and convictions, but too much is just too much. This is a movie held as a classic, based on a classic of world literature, telling a fictional story that takes place in a specific era of US history. That's it.

2 - The movie is dated. Acting, soundtrack, certain parts of the script; it all may have worked back in 1939. Not anymore.

3 - I loved the cinematography and the complexity of the story and the characters. Clark Gable was amazing as the morally ambiguous Rhett Butler. Vivien Leigh was great, though I couldn't feel at times she went OTT, but I guess that's due to the (slightly unnatural) way of acting of the era. The first 90 minutes were a solid 5 stars. Then it started to drag a little bit. The final 30 minutes or so were amazing.

Overall conclusion: It's not a perfect movie, dated, a product of its time, but it is a a great movie nonetheless. A classic everyone should watch at least once in the life.",7/10,5 July 2020,ElNapalmo,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
"Sold gold work - then, now and forever","The life and loves of a spoiled Southern rich girl living in fast changing times

Hard to know where to start with a film of this sort and this magnitude, other than to say most of the things written about it are true. And given that whole books have been written about it - that is a hell of a lot of things.

This David O Selznick produced movie not only became an event, but moved the whole art of cinema up to the level of great literature or painting. Even watching today you cannot help, but marvel at the casting, script or action. Despite what it has been boiled down to by its critics (an overheated civil war romance?), so much happens in this film that you could call it almost an action film.

Great work is more about perspiration than inspiration. Here nothing has been left to chance, the leads (Gable and Leigh) are absolutely perfect for their roles - no one could have been better cast. Equally every smaller part has a major talent playing them. This maybe the best cast film of all time. Casting costs would make it impossible today.

Yes - it is a woman's picture - and yes again - it has elements of soap opera about it. Watching three hours of anything can be hard work (some TV showings break it in to two parts), but it is well worth it.

Despite not being in my own top ten of all time favourite movies (others simply appeal to me more), ignoring what this represents in terms of technical achievement and entertaining the masses/generations would be folly. Like it or not, Gone with the Wind moved the movie making bar up not inches, but whole feet and the cinema industry would be poorer for it never having been made.",9/10,23 April 2003,Pedro_H,Gone with the Wind (1939),POSITIVE
A classic but too long to watch every now and then,"I kept hearing this was a classic film that did excellent back in 1939.

So I watched it, and my gosh it's longer than GodFather or Lord of the Rings.

Gone with the Wind is a Drama and Historical Fiction movie.

It's taken place during the Civil War. It doesn't feature any battle scenes just focuses on those who aren't fighting in the war.

The movie's all about Scralet who's a wealthy girl who'll go through a lot of hard situations through this movie. Including trying to find a life she'll enjoy and a possible love of her life.

I'm very surprised that they were able to make a movie like this back then.

It's not bad for a Civil War film. Just it's very long to watch.

Nothing inappropriate to watch but this movie might bore kids to death.

If you like seeing a memorable classic film, then you might like to check this one out. I suggest renting it before buying it.

Is a childhood worth sacrificing for wealth,"I think the quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much: it is a modern day work of literature. I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.

Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.

There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.

What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have. At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.

Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy: the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.

I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.

The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.

He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.

The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president.

The Man Who Would Be King...,"There's a man who had the world within his grip, he was the captain and director of his ship, built an empire through the news, no one challenged or refused, but such ego is quite blind to slips and trips. It all began when a young child was pulled away, from normality, from sanity, from his play; to become manipulator, fabricator, a dictator; and every day, people would pay, for what he'd spray. Without distractions he may well have been crowned king, taking everything and more that he could win, but the heart can override, lead to diatribe, broadside, and a palace becomes a prison, and he's locked in.

See it for what it is,"OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.

On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.

My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is.",7/10,21 April 2004,gobosox,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"It may not even be the best in history, but it sure is the most revolutionary.","Citizen Kane is a film with epic characteristics, and was at least 30 years ahead of his time, let's start by spectacular Gregg Toland photography, which for me is one of the top 5 best film photography, all the camera angles, metaphors, editing, close-ups, the use of natural and artificial light, mounts scenarios are something inexplicable (Remember Kane's speech), J. Mankiewicz script is great, using flashbacks (something new in time) and the timeline in your favor, I really can not say if this film was the first film to use these narrative resources, I think not, but it sure was one of the first to use a magnificent way, the soundtrack it is accurate, and the performances are very good, especially the Orson Welles doing a magnificent job, as director and actor, worth a reference scenes ""Post credit"" which explains that all the actors are new, cool also speak the name the cinematographer Gregg Toland is credited alongside Orson, Citizen Kane marked the history of cinema as we know it, so you go to see the movie today will notice that most of the ""things"" are very common nowadays and did not understand why the film is so prestigious, but remember that citizen kane invented this pile of ""things.""",10/10,1 August 2016,eagandersongil,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
tough sledding,"I have an observation concerning Rosebud (and I don't mean that story about Marion Davies). Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying ""Rosebud"" means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.

When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the ""love nest"" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!

So maybe when Kane says ""Rosebud"" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why ""Rosebud"" is the last word he speaks.

But if this is true (and it seems quite logical to me) then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it? Or has someone I just don't know it? Or could it be that this is the kind of truth that no one wants to face? That all of our lives are determined more by blind, idiot accident than by design or purpose.

why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?,"Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.

2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:

KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.

-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.

3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.

There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .",10/10,31 August 2006,elleglw,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
The Citizen Kane of Movies,"The most frequently acclaimed ""greatest film ever,"" idiosyncratic in its day yet massively influential, a cultural staple, a narrative and technical tour de force, and there's the whole thing of the wunderkind granted carte blanche for his debut to the machinery of classical Hollywood at its peak--the expectations for ""Citizen Kane,"" to say the least, are high. Indeed, it's a marvel of cinematography and plot. In both senses, there's a deep focus from various angles. The plot is a jigsaw puzzle of flashbacks from multiple sources--the ""News on the March"" film-within-the-film, the dead man's memoir, a reporter interviewing characters for the meaning of ""Rosebud""--linked by an also-layered sound design and framed by a curious camera violating the ""No Trespassing"" sign in entering and exiting the Xanadu estate. Moreover, the story is about a powerful storyteller notoriously based on William Randolph Hearst (and other famous rich guys, if not also a bit of Orson Welles)--a newspaper man, populist politician, overseer of his lover's career, and who even dictates the story beyond his grave with his final word. The picture constantly exploits a deep depth of field, with figures in the foreground and background in focus, to show it off. Much of this was accomplished by composite photographic effects. While ""Kane"" is famous as an arty old black-and-white film, which it is, it belies that it was genre-mixing popular entertainment and a special-effects extravaganza of its day: the virtuosity of the editing and sound design in addition to the matte paintings, miniatures, multiple-exposure photography, rear projection, and the most significant use of the optical printer in between ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Star Wars"" (1977). The difference is that the effects here are realistic as opposed to fantastic.

Outside of co-writer Herman Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and Welles, arguably the most important contributions to the production came from Linwood Dunn and his optical printer, and that's not even to mention a score by Bernard Herrmann, editing from Robert Wise, and contributions from a host of less well-known technicians doing career-best work, including lead matte painter Mario Larrinaga, the special-effects team's boss Vernon Walker, and art director Perry Ferguson. More than half the picture has been guessed to be effects shots. According to Dunn, ""Once Orson Welles learned about the optical printer he just went hog-wild with it.""

From the start, there's a miniature for the gate with the matte paintings of Xanadu in the background, and dissolves--lots of long dissolves in this one (and wipes and a few more dazzling effects)--transition between ever-closer views of the lit window, always matching the same frame position, until a reverse angle shot inside followed by an extreme close-up of Kane's lips, with the added snow effects, as he mutters the dying word. The reflection of the nurse in the broken snow globe was created with Dunn's printer. There are many such marvelous compositions throughout. In the ""News on the March"" reel, a terrific film-within-film newsreel parody overall (including intentional scratches and, reportedly, edited by RKO's newsreel department, to make it look authentic), a shot of construction of Xanadu is cobbled together from an actor in the foreground, stop-motion trucks in the middle plane, and the matte painting of the mansion atop the hill. There's also the pre-""Forrest Gump"" (1994), pre-""Zelig"" (1983) insertion of Kane into archival footage. Other treated shots include the camera moving through the window of the El Rancho nightclub for Susan Alexander Kane's scenes, the downward tilting shot from the miniature statue of the Thatcher library, the tilt upwards to the rafters of the workers reacting to Susan's singing, and rear projection and multiple-exposure compositions being employed where the deep, or pan, focus was otherwise impractical, such as when there were figures extremely close to the camera and in the extreme background with another plane for the middle action--the shot of young Kane through the window playing in the snow, the three-tier composite of Boss Getty observing Kane's campaign rally, Leland's firing, Susan's suicide attempt, the shot with the parrot, e.g. Of course, these effects were in service to what was already a uniquely-photographed picture.

With good reason, Welles shared the final screen credit with his cinematographer. According to Toland, the demands of deep focus and stagings and camera angles that included ceilings necessitated some unusual lighting setups, and the film has also been credited for the first extensive use of coated lenses and a new film stock. Kane walking back to the windows before sitting down in one scene is a standout that plays with perspective while also underscoring Kane's metaphorical position in the world (i.e. he feels small or distant and is literally so in the image). Similar setups are repeated for when Charles walks up to Susan practicing or in their distant exchanges of reverberating dialogue in the large mansion as she puts puzzles together. Shadows act the same way, such as when she's figuratively and literally in his shadow when he insists she continue her career. The effect is a staggeringly unique picture--not only in a showy manner, although there's an undeniable bravado to it all, but also in a way to explore figures in space in the same way as the narrative investigates characters and their perspectives.

The long takes in deep focus to keep all the figures staged in depth in sharp relief--pan focus--as assisted by the optical printer when wide-angle lenses weren't enough, in addition to the unusual angles--especially the low ones featuring ceilings--function to visually depict a plot that is also all about focusing on every character and from every angle, while much still remains in the dark. The visuals are as ambiguous and complex as the narrative: multiple perspectives, with some scenes repeated but appearing differently depending on the narrator, pan focus with figures often obscured, or just turned into silhouettes, by the harsh shadows of the chiaroscuro lighting. We never quite get a good view of the reporter Thompson, e.g., his back usually to the camera and his face in shadows when not, such as in the screening-room scene, which is apt given that he's our surrogate, the unseen spectator within the film. He even wears glasses; he sees through lenses, as we do through the camera. And, in this case, that camera is even more curious than and as much a character as Thompson and isn't slowed down by closed doors or windows and goes through a desk during one point at Kane's childhood home.

Besides Toland, Welles shared credit with co-writer Mankiewicz. The non-linear, kaleidoscopic, sometimes restricted narration and sometimes not, flashback-structured plot, with events repeated from different points of view, including a newsreel overview that mirrors the film proper, remains one of the most wonderfully convoluted film narratives. One may get overly caught up in the story and characters, but as with the imagery, it's the structure of the thing that's brilliant. The Rosebud mystery is merely a device to drive the plot. Kane isn't a character trapped in a snow globe by a single word. Everything here is multifaceted. ""You're talking to two people,"" as he says at one point. He has two wives, two friends, two sleds, scenes are doubled and framed and reflected in visual motifs--glass, windows, doorways and mirrors. Near the end, we get the iconic hall-of-mirrors shot: the film in a nutshell.

Rosebud is also part of but one or two genres in ""Kane."" It's a detective mystery, but as investigated by wisecracking newsreel reporters, like those who work at Kane's newspaper, it's an entry in the journalism films of the era--""His Girl Friday"" (1940) meets noir. It's a fictional biopic, as well as part musical (Susan's opera, the dance number at the newspaper's party), political thriller, Shakespearean tragedy and lighthearted comedy. Welles and the rest of the Mercury Players' background in radio was surely instructive, as it's the sound design that underscores these tonal shifts, equal measure playful and ominous and continually serving as transitions between scenes. The score fits seamlessly, and the editing is often inspired (e.g. the table sequence for the first marriage, or some nice match cuts throughout, as well as managing the mixture of long takes and quick montages), but there's also techniques such as overlapping dialogue and sound bridges used extensively and informed by radio practices. The shocks cuts where shot transitions are accompanied by sudden changes in sound and score may be the best, and there's a visual equivalent with the reveal of background by the sudden removal of foreground objects, such as with the newspaper in Welles' first scene.

Welles and company were already famous for the ""The War of the Worlds"" radio drama, as well as theatrical productions, so it's no wonder the makeup-enhanced acting from actors new to film was already better than the acting in most films. Like ""The War of the Worlds,"" made infamous as a catalyst of mass hysteria, its reputation only enhanced by fabricated newspaper reporting and inflated mythology, ""Kane"" demonstrates the power of storytelling, effects, genre and plot--the radio adaptation was so effective, after all, because the fictional news interrupted additional staged programming, not unlike the ""News on the March"" and other narrative tricks in the film. With the control and freedom granted from the radio-based RKO, Welles and company were able to do something even greater with the recruitment of some of the best talents in Hollywood for the primarily visual art form of cinema. There are reasons it's remained in the conversation as such, whether or not one considers it the greatest film of all time.",10/10,6 December 2020,Cineanalyst,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
One of the Greats!,"""Citizen Kane"" is possibly the most acclaimed film that I know of. It's been called the ""greatest film of all time"" by a lot of film critics, polls, magazines, etc.

The film is a chronicle of the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictional character based off of William Randolph Hearst, a famous newspaper publisher. The film's structure is highly unconventional, in which Kane's life is revealed through interviews with various people who knew him well, making a majority of the film a series of flashbacks.

On both a technical and story level the film is quite influential. The story, itself, becomes far more bleak and dark than a lot of the films coming out at that time (at least in the US, that is), and it completely insults a very powerful figure (that being William Randolph Hearst) who was still alive at the time, and fought to get the film banned (just watch the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" and the drama ""RKO 281"", two films that are also quite great).

On a technical level, there's many extremely inventive techniques being developed here. There's one particularly interesting low angle shot that was made so low because Welles actually drilled a hole in the floor of the set. Other than that shot, you mine as well look at every single other shot or scene if you want to see some technical innovation. You could just analyze it frame by frame if you want to attempt to see all of its influential visuals, and you still may not have truly seen all of the detail. As Roger Ebert said on the commentary, ""Citizen Kane"" is actually a special effects picture. The main difference between this film's special effects and the special effects in a film like ""Jurassic Park"" (another greatly influential film) is that the special effects in this film are kind of hidden, but nonetheless powerful in their own right.

A lot of people may call it the #1 most important film of all time, but I have to disagree. While it certainly is one of the most important films of all time, one really needs to go back to the silent era to find all the TRULY most important films. Films like ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Great Train Robbery"", ""The Birth of a Nation"", and ""Intolerance"". Welles, himself, actually did say during his introduction of D.W. Griffith's classic ""Intolerance"" that that film deserves all the credit for a lot of modern cinema's techniques.

However, with all its technical innovations that have been talked on and on about time and time again, I've heard very little about how ENTERTAINING the film is. ""Well that's because it isn't entertaining!"" I can hear some guy who had overly high expectations (and gave the film 1 star with a lengthy review entitled ""Disappointing"") shout. Well, you're wrong, the film is quite entertaining! Sure, there's no action sequences, explosions, Adam Sandler doesn't play his twin sister, and Kevin James doesn't wackily fall down 420,000 times, but there IS true human emotion, iconic lines of dialogue, and a truly compelling imagery that ends with one of cinema's greatest twists! There was actually a time in my life in which I watched ""Citizen Kane"" nearly once a day because I enjoyed it so much! I genuinely watched it TWICE in one day just because of how much I enjoyed it, which is very rare with me.

If you're looking for the greatest film of all time, maybe you should lower your expectations a tad bit and just experience the film for what it is.",10/10,15 February 2016,framptonhollis,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"Why Is ""Citizen Kane"" the Best Film of All Times?","Anyone who sees ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it ""for what it is,"" so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: ""it was okay."" This will not do. It is a great tragedy if ""Citizen Kane"" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" or Beethoven's ""9th Symphony"". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why ""Citizen Kane"" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and ""Citizen Kane""?

One might begin with the basic fact that ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, ""Citizen Kane"" was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that ""everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'."" Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?

First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of ""Citizen Kane"" is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in ""Citizen Kane"". The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- ""Rosebud"" -- by interviewing people who knew the man. ""It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing,"" he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' ""Oedipus Rex"" as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of ""Citizen Kane"" lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels.

Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of ""Citizen Kane"" and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. ""Citizen Kane"" is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.

More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of ""Citizen Kane"" are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, ""Citizen Kane"" remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.",10/10,31 October 2015,ilpohirvonen,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
An Expert On What People Will Think,"The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.

I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance.

What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.

Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.

The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.

What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.

The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.

The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten.",10/10,25 April 2007,bkoganbing,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Wonderful Cinematography,"If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, ""Citizen Kane"" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.

The film's B&W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.

And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.

Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.

But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.

The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.

Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. ""Citizen Kane"" should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as ""the number one greatest film in history"".

But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&W cinematography. Then, they need to let go of the guilt.",6/10,29 June 2008,Lechuguilla,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
All That Ballyhoo!,"On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic ""Citizen Kane"" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.

Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, ""Citizen Kane"" is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of ""Rosebud""-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.

From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that ""Citizen Kane"" will always stand the test of time.

However, the story of ""Citizen Kane"" remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man"" or even more recently, ""There Will Be Blood."" Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.

Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His ""Citizen Kane"" is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed.",8/10,5 May 2008,WriterDave,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Why?,"Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.

But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.

I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other ""greatnesses"" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being ""great"".

You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.

But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.

And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic ""not entertaining"" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: ""Citizen Kane is a total bore!"" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.

So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why ""the greatest movie ever made"" fails for me. 3/10",7/10,2 February 2009,b_havag,Citizen Kane (1941),NEGATIVE
Rate According To Your True Feelings.,"Yes, this title is a classic and we can all agree that it has been critically acclaimed by many to be a masterpiece. This movie pops up in so many lists of the greatest movies of all time that watching it at least once in your lifetime becomes a must. So I prepared myself for at the least a good movie. Is it a good movie? Well, yes and no.

See, it depends on why you are watching movies in the first place and where you derive pleasure from. For me watching movies is a way of entertainment and enjoyment, I want to have fun, I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to think, I want to be engaged, I want to guess what is going to happen, I want characters that I can relate to and be attached to. Now all those things don't mean that I want MINDLESS fun,I do prefer intelligent plot with great characters and development but I want the movie to incorporate entertainment value as well. Citizen Kane was a character study, it was like an assignment for my university where I had to critically evaluate the title to get a good grade.

Yes, cinematography was amazing and to think it was a movie from 1941 it is just jaw dropping. Yes, the character of Kane was complex and it was a good character study. Yes, the symbolic nature of ""Rosebud"" and what it represents was brilliantly done, especially when we see that Kane's romantic life with his women was screwed up. But all those things are meaningless to me when I don't enjoy the movie and I am ready to die from boredom. I literally forced myself to not fall asleep, all the time I was thinking ""There must be something wrong with me, this is the greatest film of all time. Get your sh*t together, wake up and pay attention. This is awesome, right?"". At some points I even thought that I must be stupid for not liking this film, but if people choose to name me stupid I don't care, at least I am honest with my feelings. What matters is that I consider myself to be fairly intelligent and I didn't see the appeal of this movie unless you are watching this for critical purposes.

Now why this movie is in the top 250 and is considered a classic? That's probably because of the technical aspects of the movie and in this sense it might be a masterpiece, but I just can't see people enjoying this so much to have it so highly rated because of the entertainment factor.

"CITIZEN KANE may let some people down, but it's still worth seeing.","It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE. Not because it's ""too old"" or ""too boring"", but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made. And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.

This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant. From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.

CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple. Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of. The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating. Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp. As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on. And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense. To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.

But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations. Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time.",No rating,2 May 2004,Cowman,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling","I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",10/10,21 October 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"While it is an example of a film I admire rather than adore, I can see why this film is seen as a classic","That is not to say I didn't love it, this film is absolutely brilliant in every respect. I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed. As for me, I loved this film very much, and while my praise doesn't completely go beyond sheer admiration I cannot deny it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10/10,27 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Citizen Welles,"Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.

Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.

The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys. A true cinematic magnum opus, without an iota of a doubt and a must for every cinema lover.",10/10,24 April 2009,murtaza_mma,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
A must film for any film maker,"There's something worth stealing from Citizen Kane if you're a film maker. What else can you say about this film except for it being the greatest gift one can give to the film industry. Having it have been a box office bomb when it opened in LA in the 1940's only adds to the films greatness. Citizen Kane was before its time and still remains today a movie marvel. There is not a single film school in the World that will not show this film at least twice to its students. A perfect film to watch and discuss for the entire class period. Citizen Kane has more examples of modern movie making than any other film made before or after.

A textbook I would have liked to study in school...,"Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.

Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively (which Welles does very convincingly) over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth, power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.

Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma- we never do get a full-bodied portrait of the man, only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they ""knew him"". In the newsreel, a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline, a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist- a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or, indeed, being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the on-screen reporters, just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud', or something he himself is not aware of?

Kane is never truly sympathetic, yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him (""If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man""), then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence, and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone (""I am Charles Foster Kane!"") yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness (""I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely""). Kane is ultimately indefinable; a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.

Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed, corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah, who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander, a thinly veiled take on Hearst's real-life mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success (For Davies this was dramatic roles in films; her talent lay in comedy). Distinguished actors Moorehead, Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.

One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay, one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she ""never gets any fun"" because they ""live in a castle"". The visual portrait is fascinating, with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess, complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge, yet empty, room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here, the sum adds up to perfect- direction, acting, writing, photography and music.

The imposing, haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA (filmed the previous year) in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's half-finished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character- grandiose, larger than life, powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.

The Role of Sheer Chance in Life,"One commentator made the original point that Kane may have uttered ""Rosebud"" as his dying word not because he was nostalgic about his childhood but rather as a symbol of sheer chance in affecting and changing his life. As the commentator pointed out, Kane would never have met Susan Alexander, his mistress and later his second wife, if he hadn't been at a warehouse looking over things from his childhood home. If Kane hadn't met Susan, his life would have turned out quite differently. Indeed, if one looks carefully at the childhood scenes of Kane's life, one would see little that Kane, as an adult, would be nostalgic about. There are strong suggestions his father beat him and that, however caring about Kane's welfare his mother was, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. Indeed, Kane's association of his sled Rosebed with the role of chance in his life would be reinforced by the fact that he was interrupted playing on Rosebud and told by his mother and Mr. Thatcher about the radically different turn his life was taking from that of a poor boy to a quite wealthy one really overnight. Indeed, by subtly showing the decisive role of chance in Kane's life, the filmmakers were undermining the powerful American myth of the self-made man. Hard work didn't make Kane's fortune, it was the result of his mother inheriting the title to a mine thought to be worthless but wasn't.

Giant of its field,"Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?

I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.

And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.

Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting.

A very solid movie with some mystery,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Citizen Kane"" (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on ""the singer"" rather on Kane's life itself.

There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.

Overall, ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015).",9/10,15 September 2015,851222,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"Essential viewing for fans of classic cinema (along with films like The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Babe: Pig in the City).","It's been nearly 80 years since the original release of Citizen Kane and I imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows the secret behind 'Rosebud', the final word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) immediately before popping his clogs. But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.

Somehow, I made it to the ripe old age of 52 without seeing Citizen Kane, but finally popped it in the DVD player to see what all the fuss is about, and while I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece myself (I believe I have very different criteria to most for that accolade), I did enjoy the film, finding it an engaging study of a powerful character, brilliantly portrayed by Welles, who goes convincingly from cocksure youngster with big ideas to an old man with more than a few regrets over the course of two hours.

Told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances of Kane, to a reporter trying to unravel the meaning of Rosebud, the film flits back and forth through the wealthy man's life: his childhood, when his parents became filthy rich and sent him East to be schooled; his building of a news empire; the Great Depression; his two marriages; a failed political career; and old age, as a recluse in his sprawling Florida mansion, Xanadu. It's a rocky ride through the ups and downs of Kane's life, in which the happiest moments were before a shed load of gold made him one of the richest men in the world (which should be a big clue as to what Rosebud refers, if you've spent your life living under a rock and don't already know).

The lack of a gratuitous sex/shower scene, ninjas, barbarians, talking animals, cyborgs, exploding heads and dwarfs mean that Citizen Kane doesn't get full marks from me, but even though it's far removed from my usual fare, I still had a good time (Welles had a great eye for an interesting shot, that's for sure). 7/10 -- glad to have finally ticked it off my list of essential classics.",7/10,27 March 2020,BA_Harrison,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
First time writing review for a reason,"Often hailed as the greatest film of all time, ""Citizen Kane"" has garnered immense praise for its technical innovations and bold narrative. However, its reputation may be overstated when considering its actual impact on audiences.

The film's acting, influenced by Orson Welles' theatrical background, feels dated and overly dramatic, making it difficult for modern viewers to connect emotionally with the characters.

While its non-linear structure was groundbreaking, the fragmented storytelling can feel unfocused and self-indulgent. The quick dialogue and shifting perspectives often sacrifice clarity and emotional depth for the sake of cleverness.

Compared to other classics like ""Casablanca,"" ""Citizen Kane"" falls short in emotional impact. Its thematic exploration of power and corruption lacks the personal resonance that makes a film truly memorable.

While ""Citizen Kane"" was undeniably innovative, its status as the greatest film ever made is greatly questionable. The overacting, disjointed narrative, and lack of emotional connection suggest that its reputation may owe more to critical hype than to genuine cinematic greatness.",5/10,22 August 2024,manulapique,Citizen Kane (1941),NEGATIVE
The march of time...,"Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble. It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories. The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized. At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains. Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.

As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity. Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death. The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently destructive of human values. Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I might have been a really great man.

What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore). Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.

Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man. This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar. Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time. He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.

Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules. The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations. A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another. Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.

Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.

So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.

Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made. Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film. When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target. Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.

It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane. It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.

Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music. Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears. Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century",No rating,13 August 2002,Mr_Hulot,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
A true original,"RKO was the smallest of the Big Five Hollywood studios and the purveyor of mainly undistinguished genre pictures. For this reason they hired a young theatre producer called Orson Welles to make a prestige film. Welles had just shook up radio with his production of The War of the Worlds, a broadcast that was so innovative and realistic it caused widespread panic throughout the United States with some people really believing that Martians were attacking. Welles was given free reign to make the film he wanted. This was unprecedented for an untried film-maker. The film's central character resembled newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The film was delayed several months while RKO tried to appease Hearst's lawyers. It was well received by the critics but not a popular success. It would remain the high point of Welles career and the one time he enjoyed such complete control. This led in part to the auteur theory where masterpieces of cinema were attributed to the director's genius. However, this is too simplistic as Welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. The former provided a disciplined structure for Welles to work off and the latter the deep focus photography that allowed him to manipulate cinematic space in a way that strengthened the story. The combination of deep focus and long takes allowed for scenes where characters moved around the cinematic space in ways that heightened the drama considerably.

Citizen Kane is often considered a triumph of technique but it's really the way in which the technique was used and controlled to strengthen the story that makes it so notable. It wasn't the first film to utilise deep focus or long takes but it was the first one to use them so systematically. It combined many opposites – social comment / surrealism, European art film / Hollywood entertainment, comedy / tragedy, realism / expressionism. Kane himself is presented in a variety of ways – dreamlike images of him dying, a remote public figure, a man known by wife and friends and finally a detached being. This reality is expressed by a combination of objective fact and subjective opinion. The beginning of the movie illustrates opposites of approach. We begin with a subjective dreamlike death scene and immediately are thrust into the objective 'News on the March' segment that mimics the news documentary in a similar way to how Welles mimicked the radio news in The War of the Worlds. In this part we are told the whole narrative in summary. It's a microcosm of the film as a whole. After this we then piece together the story of Kane's life via the accounts of various people who knew him, all interviewed by Thompson, a man whose face we never see because he really represents us. The use of flashbacks, multiple narrators and an ambiguous conclusion was a very innovative one for the time. The film as a whole resembles one of the jigsaws that Kane's second wife Susan works on, each piece contributed another truth but some pieces are missing. To add to the complexity of the film, different people offer contrasting judgements that make up the differing periods of his life. Welles once remarked that 'the point of the picture is not so much the solution of the problem as its presentation'.

Thompson realises that no single word can 'explain a man's life' and so it proves with 'Rosebud'. The sledge and paperweight represent the time when Kane was happiest and the love he lost but it's left essentially ambiguous and is never fully explained. Kane seeks to regain the love he lost for the rest of his life but always on his own terms, this leads to the ruin of his career and relationships. He winds up in Xanadu his very own pleasure dome with caves of ice. The final tracking shot moves slowly over the expensive rubbish that Kane has accumulated; as we pan forward we see items from further and further back in the story until we find the fateful Rosebud sledge. The 'answer' to our quest.

Childhood Ultimately makes the Determination,"More movie review lists have awarded ""Citizen Kane"" the honor of being the best film ever made than any other film whatsoever..Deservedly so!! Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane (based on William Randolph Hearst) was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year, that award was given to ""How Green was My Valley"". Reluctance to allow a film like ""Citizen Kane"" to be released, evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that ""Citizen Kane"" so succinctly illustrated, left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!! (Wizard of Oz is a stellar example)...Nevertheless, ""Citizen Kane"" hit the big screen, and from there, received unprecedented critical acclaim!!

What was the attraction?.... Charles Foster Kane was a neglected and irascible man who concocted a myriad of avoidable vulnerabilities in his life. His childhood became a pitfall of doom and despair which left an indelible mark on him!! His empathy for the working class people inevitably translated to his perception of them as chattel, and that he must be the ameliorated recipient of their gratitude!! His fame and fortune was predicated on the idea that the banal proletariat be relegated to the pathetic plight of a marketable commodity!! So many concepts were avant-gard in this movie, this is why they were widely unacceptable!! Concepts such as: The life of a corporate mogul being the culprit to making Charles Foster Kane fall prey to vanity and social entitlement!! He became a victim of megalomania, this was his ultimate downfall!! The dark human emotions and vindictiveness of politicians seeking election and/or re-election manifested themselves through very authentic reactions from the characters in this film!! The perennial egocentric demeanor which afflicted Charles Foster Kane throughout the entire movie, signified a pejorative compassion which was totally self centered!!!

The character portrayal of Charles Foster Kane by Orson Wells was outstanding..Genuine feelings that were related to selfishness and avarice in this movie simply astounded me!! People have to consider the year this movie was made (1941) to fully appreciate the ideas which were thrown out at the movie audience!! No matter how reprehensible Charles Foster Kane was, he was also NEWS!!! This will always be the way of the world!! This newspaper king wound up being utterly thwarted by a form of convoluted justice!!! Leaving a largess of artwork behind, merely pointed out to everyone that his priorities purported a horrid arrogance!! The onus was on the movie audience to get acquainted with the despicable aspects of negative emotional qualities that Charles Foster Kane masqueraded around like coveted trophies!! Ultimately, his childhood put a lethal spin on his adverse reactions to everything, and played a significant role in this movie!! I strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in movies, that they see this film!! ""Godfather"" ""Shawshank Redemption"" ""Lord of the Rings"" (Fellowship of the Ring) and ""Gold Rush"" have all been selected as the greatest movie ever made by one critic's list or another, but, not nearly as often as ""Citizen Kane"" though!!! ""Citizen Kane"" is an absolutely remarkable movie!!",10/10,30 October 2006,dataconflossmoor,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Undoubtedly the greatest American film ever created.,"Citizen Kane, the film, is many things. It is a brilliantly crafted series of flashbacks and remembrances. It is an engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world. It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers. It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom. Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema. There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece. The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud. The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life.

From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically. Citizen Kane, undeniably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created.",10/10,19 July 2001,QulkSiLvR,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
The Great American Film,"Why would I ever write any kind of review on CITIZEN KANE, a film that's been analyzed to death and is considered to film what Shakespeare is considered to literature? I actually have a good reason: in recent years, I've noticed more and more people seem to dislike the film, mostly because of its hype. Supposedly Ingmar Bergman called it boring. Now I happen to be a Bergman fan, but considering the dude made some pretty slow-paced movies, those are strong words! I can understand why many might feel let down by the story. The hype ""Greatest Movie of All Time"" implies that you are in for a great, sweeping GONE WITH THE WIND-style epic. Instead it's a smaller film about an unsavory character. It also focuses a lot on the newspaper business, which may not seem very relevant to modern audiences. My friend Zelda summed it up quite well:

""I think that at this point, the film is more appreciated by directors than it is by general audiences. I know that what Orson Welles was doing with the camera, with angles, lighting, whatnot, was revolutionary - but I know this because I've been told this. As a plebeian when it comes to such things, those aspects don't stand out for me as much, and I understand they're big factors in what make that movie a classic. Instead what I have is a puzzle of a story, which, while interesting, is not compelling emotionally enough for me to place it in my top films list.""

This is a fair point, so here is what I propose. I will write a review about KANE where I will not ONCE mention the technical breakthroughs of the film. Forget about the cinematography, score, editing, etc. I will simply analyze the film's Story and why I feel that it is actually a very powerful and heartbreaking story.

CITIZEN KANE can be summed up easily: it's the story of a man who can never get over having been rejected by his mother and is incapable of feeling love.

This point might only be fully clear on repeat viewings. Mrs. Kane only has one scene in the movie, but we linger on her a bit, allowing her to dominate the scene. After that she is only mentioned in passing. Kane talks about her death on the same night that he meets Susan for the first time. We never know exactly how Kane feels about her, and what exactly he is thinking when he tears the room apart is left to our imaginations, but we feel the weight of it. We observe him cheat on one wife with the next and we're not told why. Yet when analyzing the facts, we do know why. We also observe him alienate his friends. On the surface this may seem to just be a petty drama, but only after we get the full story are we able to understand why this man so desperately needed to be loved.

Kane remains elusive; he is ultimately the protagonist of the Story, but he is always a mystery to us, and he is portrayed both positively and negatively. This moral ambiguity applies to most of the supporting the characters as well. If you notice, we remain on a last-name basis with almost every character in the film: Kane, Leland, Bernstein, Thatcher, and Thompson. With Thompson it is taken a step further in that we never even see his face properly, making it clear that although we are following this reporter around, he is more a symbol than a character, and it is Kane's story that should be our focus. Developing the characters in this way makes them seem like regular people, occupying a story rather than starring in it.

Finally, there's the issue of the ending. Rosebud is obviously a MacGuffin and perhaps people were expecting some sort of big reveal. The film has the confidence to end on a puzzle; Rosebud is revealed not in the style of a detective solving the case with a big ""Aha!"" gimmick, but as a subtle artifact that rewards us for paying attention and makes us think about how it fits in. Had the film ended in a different way, perhaps we wouldn't be talking about it today, but the fact that only moments after Rosebud is revealed it is then destroyed are perhaps the saddest moments of the story and what have caused the tale to resonate.

I don't think any film deserves the title ""greatest ever made"" because that's obviously going to be subjective. Here it is has perhaps done more harm than good. If CITIZEN KANE were a novel, it would not be a great sweeping epic like WAR AND PEACE, which is perhaps what too many people expect. It would be a very short and quiet novel. It is about a person's life, but it only observes it rather than embellishes it. It is not a melodrama but a voyeuristic study. At the end of the film, we see Kane's entire lifetime reduced to boxes and boxes of scrap, and we are asked whether or not a man's life can be summed up so simply. Or maybe we know that such a collection of junk is all any of us will ever have.

Fascinating--But Increasingly Problematic With The Passage of Time,"In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made. This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.

To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem. A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage. Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal. And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.

The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore. They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates. As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longer offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.

There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels. Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.

Most important movie ever made,"Kane ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was Orson Welles' film debut, and in it he created an enduring masterpiece that is considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made.

Story:

Shortly after ""Citizen Kane"" opens, we see aged newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Welles) softly drawl the word ""Rosebud"" and die. Sensing that there's a story behind Kane's dying word, a magazine editor shows a reporter a newsreel obituary that chronicles how Kane created a business empire, married a U.S. President's niece, ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York, divorced his first wife and married a second, collected art, built a fabulous estate called Xanadu, and divorced his second wife. The reporter is then assigned the task of ferreting out the significance of ""Rosebud."" As the reporter's investigation progresses, fascinating details about Kane emerge.

My opinion:

Citizen kane is maybe for a lot of people (myselve not included) not a real entertaining movie, But there is no doubt about it that aws one of the most important movies ever made.

The visual style of ""Citizen Kane"" looks stunningly fresh and inventive even today, and the unconventional narrative structure of the Oscar-winning screenplay still seems daring. Welles' portrayal of a character who gradually ages from 25 to old age is unexcelled, and the movie's supporting cast, most of whom had worked previously with Welles on stage and radio productions, is superb. In short, everything came together in ""Citizen Kane"" to make it one of the greatest character studies ever captured on film.

Citizen kane is also one of my favorites and is listed in my top 5 of all time: 9.5 / 10 Masterpiece !!!",9/10,8 November 2005,bartvanbenthem,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE

A case study in projection,"I rented this movie almost accidentally on the route back from shooting pool, without any preconceptions of what it was about, although I was very aware it had been dubbed ""the greatest film ever"" by many.

Basically, the film asks a highly abstract question of whether we can reconstruct a puzzle from a set of available pieces: are the pieces independent or can there be a piece which fundamentally affects the reconstruction? It also presents a very specific example of how this kind of projection applies to human psychology: can there be a single event or item, a ""rosebud"", such that a man's life cannot be wholly understood without it? We all project our persona every day to our fellow human beings, but no one else really knows what's running in our minds as we lay in bed in the evening: the portions of our minds with no trespassing.

I especially like how this theme is shown on so many levels at once. At the bottom, the reporter is trying to reconstruct Kane's life by anecdotal evidence; Kane's readers are trying to reconstruct the world state by Kane's newspaper; and finally, we the viewers are trying to reconstruct the meaning of the film by watching it. The film was based on the media mogul William Randolph Hearst, whose persona the writers first shattered to pieces and then reconstructed to form Charles Foster Kane.

An interesting add to the interpretation (forgot the name of the critic behind it) is that the whole movie is imagination, or self-inspection, by Kane himself in seek of his rosebud. In this case, the unseen Thompson could be seen as Kane himself, trying to find his lost childhood innocence from the inner depths of his mind.

"Gaudy Reputation, But a Dull Film","I really can't find anything in ""Citizen Kane"" worth liking. Do I see what the big fuss is about? Sure. And it is one of the best looking and most well made film of the 40s (from what I've seen. I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with ""great"" films such as this). ""Citizen Kane"" is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch ""Citizen Kane"" ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with ""Citizen Kane."" Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes.

A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of ""All the King's Men"" is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). ""All the King's Men"" does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. ""Citizen Kane"" is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say.

It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score. If you don't, then your taste will dictate how effective it was. For me, ""Citizen Kane"" is another major disappointment to add to the heap of ""disappointing classics.""",6/10,11 August 2010,DaveDiggler,Citizen Kane (1941),NEGATIVE
The Great Cinema Swindle,"I know why you're reading this. You're smart, you have great taste, a passion for cinema, and you see CK near the top of every 'Great Movie' list ever compiled. So with great anticipation you borrow a DVD copy and sit down for a real treat, and... you can't get through the first half hour. You fall asleep.

Surprised, you think, 'It must be me, maybe I'm tired,' so a month later, you try again. But you don't even get as far as before, and wake up drooling out the corner of your mouth as a bloated Orson Welles, with really bad age make-up, groans 'Rosebud, Rosebud'.

It doesn't make sense. You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer, cry, laugh, feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique, like 8 1/2, which you reckon reinvented cinema language, weaving in and out of memory, dreams, psyche, reality, putting the human spirit up on the screen, making you cheer, laugh, and feel connected to all humanity.

So why does CK leave you so cold? You wonder, 'What's wrong with me? Am I stupid or something?'

Your borrowed DVD copy gathers dust (notice how the lender never asks for it back?), taunting your unquiet mind: ""You must watch me: I'm the greatest film of all time!"" But you shudder at the thought. Life's too short and, after all, there's more engaging things to do - like scraping plaque off the dog's teeth.

Years pass. Finally, you can take it no longer. You think, 'To be a serious film lover I MUST watch Citizen Kane! Maybe I was too immature before - yes, that must be it!' So you gird your loins and sit - awake! - through the whole thing. The whole turgid, ponderous, dull, vacuous, plodding, dank catastrophe. It's even worse than you feared. An emotionally and intellectually empty story. Your average six year old can invent a more complex, engaging tale.

Genuinely puzzled, you ask people who name it as one of the greatest films of all time why they like it, and with barely concealed superiority that phoneys are wont to adopt, they wax lyrical talk about the haunting mystery of the final words, ""Rosebud, rosebud"". You notice there's no feeling behind what they say. They also talk a great deal about Gregg Toland's cinematography, with liberal references to ""deep focus"", and you appreciate this, you really do, the cinematography was damned fine, best thing about the movie. That shot which started outside the window then tracked back into the room was really cool. But you just don't believe a movie is made great by cinematography alone.

In all your inquiries, you never once hear the following phrase, spoken from the heart: ""God, I love that film"".

So here you find yourself, reading IMDb comments.

Well, let me tell you this: There's Nothing Wrong With You! You Are Right! It's Overrated Flashy Unintelligent Rubbish!

One day, perhaps (one can but dream), the coolest, greatest, most admired film being in the world will point out the bleeding obvious nakedness of this bloated Emperor, and the assorted film critics, film studies teachers, and others who need to be told what to think by an authority figure, shall squirm, and CK shall drop off the lists once and for all.

an example of a unique and well done movie,"The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal. He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters. News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune. Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died. The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud' as his last word. Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu. It has a sign that says `no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate. The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way. He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom. Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie. The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time. Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie. He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate. I thought that this movie was well done. It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized. One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control. Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well. The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable. This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques. I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.",No rating,17 November 2003,meggs212,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"One of the great films, if not ""the"" greatest.","MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH.

""Citizen Kane"" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest American films ever made. Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget, actors, script, and more.

He plays Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words ""Rosebud."" So the film starts off by searching for what ""rosebud"" really means. We see countless relations of Kane interviewed. None of them know what ""rosebud"" really means. But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life, and eventually the mystery unfolds itself.

Like Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru,"" ""Citizen Kane"" is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness. Kurosawa claims he never saw ""Citizen Kane"" before making his film, but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing.

""Citizen Kane"" has, perhaps, some of the best makeup ever seen on film. A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something, overweight man. (And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life.)

I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert, who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in ""Citizen Kane"" than in the ""Star Wars"" films.Though subtle, I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film. They're so flawless it's hard to even notice.

Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are, which creates a feeling of paranoia. All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time.

And if you want symbolism, this film is for you. As Kane hands over his empire in one scene, he walks over to a window, which to the naked eye looks normal-sized. But as Kane nears the window, guess what? Turns out the window is very, very high. It makes Kane look small. Think about it. He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth. It's all very symbolic.

I recommend picking up the DVD; it also contains a two-hour documentary called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" plus many, many more tidbits, including the original theatrical trailer (which is very odd and original).

All in all, ""Citizen Kane"" is a classic of epic proportions. One of the very greatest American films out there.

Love The Cinematography; Story Not That Appealing,"Hey, make no mistake: this film does deserve lofty status. It is a good film, fantastically photographed.....but the greatest of all time? I question that, but that kind of question - Who's number one? - is impossible to answer.

I would think to be number one you would have to have a great technical film, great story, great acting, great camera-work as this has, AND have it generally loved by the public. Then you have a true number one picture of all time. I'm not a fan of ""Gone With The Wind,"" but that was a technical marvel, too, for its day and was universally loved by millions of people....so I can see that being listed number over Citizen Kane. The same goes for Casablanca, Ben-Hur and a number of wonderful films.

Anway, concerning this movie, I enjoyed it best for the cinematography. Orson Welles, the ""genius"" behind this film, was ahead of his time with his inventive camera-work. The acting is good and it's interesting to note that this was Welles' first acting role. Yes, he was an amazing talent, behind or in front of the camera. The story is pretty unlikable and, in this day and age would be too boring for most people under 50, sad to say. However, even older, more ""mature"" folks find this hard to get through sometimes from what I have read.

The unlikable part mainly comes from the lead character, ""Charles Foster Kane,"" played by Welles. He is simply a selfish egomaniac. Other unpleasant parts of the story include several scenes with his second wife, in which she berates him in this shrill hysterical voice; the fact there is very little humor in here and the ending is anything but uplifting.

For those who find this a confusing story, I suggest giving it another chance. I found this film better the more chances I gave it. It also looks fabulous on the latest special-edition DVD. In summary, it was a great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have the same mindset and are afraid to be their own person, so don't feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesn't do it for you. You are hardly alone. But, yet, that camera-work has to be seen and appreciated if you really love movies.",8/10,13 December 2005,ccthemovieman-1,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
How to frame it,"From the very start, it is made clear what we will get here. A very controlling and aware movie. The frame of the window ... well if you watch the different shots that lead up to the house, you will notice it too, I won't have to point it out. And as controlled and rehearsed that was, as much is the rest of the movie. Especially when it comes to framing, but also lighting. The movie made use of many different techniques to keep the cost down, but still look epic - and it succeeded, thanks to the complete control Orson Welles had over it.

Something unprecedented back then. A first time movie director having all the control? Apparently there were some spies on the set, but Welles knew of and about them and tricked them in some instances (like with scenes where you couldn't see the main characters because of backlighting).

This is as much a technical achievement as it is an achievement in storytelling. Especially considering we already know at the beginning what will happen, just to unfold (through interviews) and fill in the blanks. Rosebud - more than just what it was but what it stands for. It is about something rather than just one thing. A lot of interpretation can be made, because a lot of thought had gone into the movie. Welles knew what he wanted and while it may feel ""boring"" to some viewers now, he achieved everything he set out to do.

So love it or hate it, the movie is above any criticism - which again does not mean you have to like it or rate it higher than what you feel it deserves to get. Just remember: if you don't like it or do like it a lot, does not make your opinion better or more right than others on it. This is hailed as a classic for many reasons though, try to enjoy it for what it is, not what you would want it to be",10/10,10 July 2020,kosmasp,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"A cinematic landmark, and an achievement in any aspect of life","Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made. Though I cannot comment fairly on that (I haven't even seen half of the nominated 100) I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is marvellous. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them; Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.

I heard from a few average (but movie-loving) people that they thought Citizen Kane was good, but not superb or as good as it was supposed to be. I read so many great reviews, and really did think the reviewers were simply afraid to put this historic film out of place. I apologise: Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.

Nearly everything is spot on. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.

And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.

Top banana, this is.

Don't see it before you mature,"I was wrong in seeing the film for the first time as a teenager (14-15). I wasn't mature enough to grasp the meaning of the movie and the entire plot. Because of that first view, I've been under the impression that the film is strange and alienated.

Yesterday I decided that it deserves a second view, now that I'm a little bit older (22) and have seen more than enough films, compared to when I was younger.

I just finished watching it and it left me with teary eyes and a lump in my throat. I was moved - and didn't even see it coming.

When I first saw the film I couldn't relate to Charles Foster Kane, and it wrecked the film for me - until I decided to watch it again.

In my opinion, the early and final years of Charles are those that make the film get under your skin and into your heart.",10/10,22 June 2010,goodguy-16,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Citizen Kane (1941) ****,"I am totally elated to say I've just had my first - and by no means my last - wonderful experience with the well-labeled ""classic"" that is CITIZEN KANE.

I decided to see it bright and early, at 7:30 am where I could be at my most alert and perceptive. It did not disappoint me in a single way. And even though I was fully prepared in advance to think ""there's just no way this is going to be the 'best film ever made',"" the more I became entranced in it, the more I understood precisely why so many fans and critics over the decades have bestowed such an honor on it. It's a truly great motion picture - and if I'm not presently prepared to call it ""The Single Greatest Film Ever Made,"" I certainly think it's one of the greatest, at least that I've ever seen.

I must say with regret, however, that I'd already heard what ""Rosebud"" was before watching the movie, and that's a real shame. Because I would have been totally blown away by that bittersweet revelation had I not expected it. The only thing for me to hope for was that, at least, the manner in which this information was revealed in the film would be properly dramatic and effective, and not just some character telling its meaning or some other less than stellar presentation. I was actually hoping that the movie would end with the ""Rosebud"" object somehow being amidst Kane's personal possessions -- but who would ever have though that it was going to be SO brilliantly revealed - with such grandeur! Absolutely perfect - drama at its finest!

The performances were marvelous, beginning with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (what a shame to think Cotten was ultimately to be handed such junk as LADY FRANKENSTEIN later on). I spotted people I never expected to see, such as George Coulouris as Thatcher (another who wound up in Grade Z horrors like 1957's THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY!).

I was totally intrigued with the character of Chuck Kane continuously, and I loved the manner in which this well-crafted story was told via flashbacks and time leaps backward and forward. Of course, the cinematography was second to none and, I imagine, astonishingly fresh and innovative for its day. Dialogue was great, too; I particularly liked one funny bit where the elderly Thatcher tells the young adult Kane: ""You're too old to call me 'Mister'"", to which Welles replies, ""and you're too old to be called anything else"" !

Orson Welles was a genius with this work of art. I can't wait to dig into the documentary, and perhaps even Roger Ebert's commentary. To think that Welles was so young when he fashioned this beautiful film, and had complete creative license! This is what I like with a director when I can get it - one who is in charge of everything, not just someone who is merely directing someone else's ideas. I like a director to conceive, write, direct, and edit everything (at this point I'm not positive that Welles did it ALL, but he did enough!).

Well, I could go on forever at this moment, but I'll let others get a word or two in. All I can say is - if you hadn't guessed by now - this baby's got a space on my shelf with its name on it! And by the way, EXCELLENT restoration job, Warner!",10/10,10 June 2004,JoeKarlosi,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
I just don't get it being considered one of the greatest movies ever,"After hearing for years, perhaps decades, that ""Citizen Kane"" was one of, if not, the greatest film ever made, I watched it. Perhaps because of all the hype, it was a letdown for me. From what others have written, it was a breakthrough film of its time. But I'm not watching it in 1941, I'm watching it in 2021. After watching movies for the past 50+ years, this one just didn't do much for me. It certainly didn't entertain me. The acting is great, but that wasn't enough to carry it for me. I would only recommend watching it just so you can say, ""Yeah, I finally watched it, but..."".

A Reputation Deserved,"There's not much to say about ""Citizen Kane"" that hasn't already been said. I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in ""Kane"" have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective. I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think ""Kane""'s uniqueness will be apparent. I don't think the film is without flaws. Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags. The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch ""Kane"" for the originality of the story. Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it. When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story? Do you really know what happened to him?

This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised? The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved. That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.

And if none of this is reason enough to watch ""Citizen Kane,"" just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions. Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.

And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role. Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.

And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.

Grade: A+

Overrated but still an incredible achievement,"Changed moviemaking forever. Ahead of its time. A cinematography and editing marvel for sure. It's still a painfully boring and emotionless story however, and I don't think it gets better with repeat viewings like some say.

There are two other flaws: the acting, apart from Welles, is sometimes terrible. You can tell these are first timers and you call they are stage actors. Also, not that it's that important, but the makeup is really bad. It looks like they are wearing weird reptilian latex masks.

The Title MAKES it Important Enough!,"I was troubled by a lot of aspects of the AFI's 1998 list, but Citizen Kane wasn't one of them; it thoroughly deserved the #1 spot. A magnificent story regarding the search for contentment and happiness among the squalor of cold material things. Kane's search is a paradox in itself; his happiness lies in a single material object - Rosebud - which represents his innocence and carefree happiness of childhood. The irony is that the other material objects he procures in this search only hinder his efforts. Welles' dramatic effects and his symbolic method of storytelling would make Melville proud; he always notes who is in shadow, what music is playing where, what position his characters are in, etc. The best ever.

Has a film ever been more praised and loved by film critics than Citizen Kane?,"Has a film ever been more praised and loved by film critics than Citizen Kane? Some people will say The Godfather or Casablanca hold that title, but I think it's Citizen Kane. The praise is certainly deserved, because this is certainly is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Much more fascinating is the fact that it was almost never released and close to be destroyed. Welles had already created controversy with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast that shocked America, but that was nothing compared to what erupt thanks to Citizen Kane. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst believed that the film painted an unflattering image of him and was determined to bury the film, along with Welles. Due to Hearst's power of the press and radio waves, the film was barely advertised and flopped on its initial release. It would also lose the Best Picture Oscar to John Ford's sentimental How Green Was My Valley (considered by many to be the Academy's biggest mistake ever). Kane would disappear and only after both the careers of Hearst and Welles fell did it start to gain an audience upon numerous re-releases from the 1950's onward. It was praised by critics as a masterpiece and Welles was put alongside Chaplin and Ford as one of cinema's greatest artists. More and more acclaim is given to Citizen Kane each day and rightfully so.

Millionaire tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies one night in his bed at his giant castle, Xanadu with his very last word, ""Rosebud."" A reporter (William Alland) working on a news reel about Kane is soon asked by his boss to investigate the importance of the word. So, he begins to interview previous colleagues of the newspaper runner, which leads to various flashbacks of his life. After his mother becomes rich, she sends Charles away with a bank owner and he soon grows into a prosperous man, who decides that ""it would be fun to run a newspaper."" He gains control of The Inquirer, which soon blossoms into a major enterprise. He soon marries the president's daughter and runs for senator. After that breaks off, he meets a young woman who he wants to become a successful singer, but she is not able to hold a tune. Yet, through all of this, does the reporter ever find out what ""Rosebud"" means?

Citizen Kane has been looked into and analysed by many critics (including one providing a commentary for the DVD) and almost everybody has a different interpretation. I, for one, view it as a story of a man who despite gaining a lot of money, never really became happy and that one word is Kane realising that his death is probably the best thing to have ever happened to him. Kane becomes so insanely wealthy and successful, that he forgets what life is all about, which explains why he just melts away in Xanadu for all the years after his second wife's divorce. Kane may not be the kindest gentleman, but he certainly is fascinating, which is probably what adds to the everlasting appeal of Citizen Kane. Orson Welles set out to tell the story of one man and made a masterpiece and a classic motion picture history. His performance, direction and screenplay are all perfect in every way. His supporting players, which he brought to Hollywood with him from the Mercury Theatre are all impressive as well. Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, also deserves heaps of praise for his brilliant camera work and lighting effects.",10/10,5 July 2007,stefanbe,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Best movie of all times,"Citizen Kane is so far my favorite movie of all times. This movie has great acting, lighting, plot, and so much more. I first saw this movie around the beginning of the year 2015 with my dad. At first I also didn't understand what was happening with all of the time jumps, and stories. Once I saw it a couple of time, I got what was going on, and loved it. Citizen Kane has a lot of story behind the scenes. Orson Wells based the movie on a man named William Randolf Hearst. When the movie released, Hearst wanted Citizen Kane to be destroyed, and never seen by anyone because the movie pretty much tells about his entire life. There is so much more about what happened in between Hearst and Wells, but it is an amazing story. Citizen Kane is a perfect definition of an excellent movie. If you ask me, I say that everyone should see this movie. Citizen Kane isn't a movie for everyone though. If you're a big movie person, and willing to see any movie, than watch Citizen Kane.

"Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, ""Citizen Kane"" electrified a complacent industry","""Citizen Kane"" was a dazzling movie debut for Welles, a twenty-four-year-old infant terrible whose brilliant work for stage and radio had already made him famous

RKO had given him carte blanche, and with the collaboration of writer Herman Mankiewicz and photographer Gregg Toland, he had produced a masterpiece

""Citizen Kane"" is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a rich young man who decides to build a newspaper empire and in doing so sacrifices his professed high ideals on the altar of yellow journalism His personal, political ambitions are ruined when his extramarital liaison with a young singer becomes public knowledge and his efforts to make her an international opera star bring him nothing but ridicule Having alienated his friends and wives and lost a good part of his fortune, Kane spends his last years alone in the enormous art-filled palace he has had created in Florida

Told primarily in flashbacks, the film begins with Kane's death: after dropping a paperweight that simulates a snowfall when it is turned upside down, the old man whispers a single word, ""Rosebud,"" and dies Immediately a strident Mach-of-Time newsreel begins, reviewing the highlights of Kane's career as the camera had recorded them over the years It is, however, an unsatisfactory record of a man's life, and a group of journalists decide to probe deeper in an attempt to discover the truth about Kane Perhaps, they speculate, the word ""Rosebud"" offers a clue... Then ensues a series of interviews with the key people in Kane's life, each of whom relates the man's story as he or she knew it...

The portrait that eventually emerges is one of a grasping, vain, selfish, and ambitious man... ""He never gave you anything,"" an old friend recalls bitterly, ""he just left you a tip."" In the film's final moments, workmen in Kane's palace are seen destroying unwanted junk One of the items they toss into the furnace is a child's sled; as it burns, the word ""Rosebud"" can be seen painted on it

The story of Charles Foster Kane is engrossing but not particularly profound The movie is a superb piece of film-making, nonetheless, because the techniques employed, although not necessarily new, had never before been used together to such startling effect Welles and Toland made brilliant use of deep-focus photography and of an arsenal of lighting effects

In the course of the film, flashbulbs pop, spotlights play, the sun's rays pour down into darkened rooms, beams of light are emitted by a movie projector, lightning flashes, and smoke, fog shadows, rain, and snow all contribute to the almost tangible atmosphere Quick, dramatic cuts occur throughout In one famous sequence, Welles employs six fast scenes to portray the disintegration of Kane's first marriage: each shot shows Kane and his wife at the breakfast table, but in each they are clearly more estranged until, in the final shot, they sit in silence as she reads a rival newspaper

Toland's constantly moving camera is somewhat obtrusive, but it is nevertheless mesmerizing In the famous sequence at the opera housethe occasion of the second Mrs. Kane's disastrous debutthe camera shows the anguished vocal coach in the conductor's box and then moves upward to the flies, where one stagehand expresses his critical opinion of the performance by holding his nose Welles' use of sound, ranging from thunder to a cockatoo's screech, reflects his experience in radio

There had never been a picture like ""Citizen Kane."" It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, ""Citizen Kane"" electrified a complacent industry Welles dominated Kane He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941

The story is amazing, everything is amazing, it truly won an worthy Oscar. The screenplay is also truly great, the dialogue and characters and everything are great. The acting is great, Orson Welles is amazing in the lead, great. The direction is great, Orson Welles again is a very talented filmmaker in every way, he's a great actor, great writer, great director, and this is his best film. The visual effects are great, amazing. Its great for now, much less 1941, how did they get so great visual effects than, they didn't exist.

The Distinguished Citizen ...,"There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.

It is a neat camera trick and KANE is full of neat camera tricks. It discretely plays with our perception of reality, just as the story does. Through out, Charles Foster Kane is at a distance and slightly out of focus and then he is up close and personal; he is larger than life and suddenly small and petty; he is always at the center of the picture, yet concedes the foreground to the various witnesses who tell his story. CITIZEN KANE is a treasure chest of cinematic gadgets and gizmos; yet as deliciously stylized as KANE is, the style meshes perfectly with the content. CITIZEN KANE is a story of illusions and perceptions told through illusions and perceptions.

Before KANE, and for the most part afterward, no film has quite taken hold of the medium of film and done so much with it. Other directors have tried to dazzle us with how cleverly stylish they can make their films, but usually the effect is self-consciously arty: Every rabbit pulled out of a hat is greeted with a drum roll and a fanfare. The beauty of KANE and the reason director Orson Welles remains an artist of awed respect, arise from the casual grace with which he performed his magic tricks. His rabbits are in themselves so fascinating that how he produces them is only of secondary interest. Yet for a film obsessed with stylistic trickery, CITIZEN KANE still manages to be an incredibly personal story.

To say a film is efficient may seem like a backhanded compliment, but part of the wonder of KANE is that it tells so much story and covers so much territory on a B-movie budget. It is an epic created on sound stages and with editorial mosaics. Welles begins his film with a mock newsreel obituary announcing Kane's passing, then basically repeats aspects of that same story several times over from different perspectives, maintaining a vague chronology, but jumping around in time to let us know that there is more to a life than the mere passage of time. Welles tells us who Kane was to the world, then who he was to the people who actually knew him -- suggesting that who we are is defined not by what we have done but by who we have touched. It is one of the most effective and insightful film biographies that was ever made. The fact that it is a biography of a fictional character is totally irrelevant.

The essence of CITIZEN KANE is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Like the blind men, who, upon examining only a part of the beast, assume that the elephant is a rope (the tail), a tree (a leg), a sword (a tusk), etc., the witnesses to Kane's life see him as a spoiled child, an idealist, a hypocrite, a monster and so on and so forth. All are correct, yet all are wrong, only seeing in Kane what they want to see. We never meet Kane the man, only Kane the illusion, yet we end up with a vague grasp of who he must have been. If CITIZEN KANE offers any universal truth it is that a life -- or a movie -- is more than the sum of the parts.

Even given all the well-deserved praise proffered to Welles as a director, he never seems to get his due as an actor. His embodiment of Charles Foster Kane is, simply put, one of the great screen performances of all time. We remember that KANE saw Welles as a first time director, but it was also his first time on screen professionally and he gives a performance that is both self-assured and subtle, bold and bemused. Taking Kane from his twenties to his sunset years without a false note, giving a performance that combines gentle humor with grandiose theatrics, Welles creates a character of shifting moods and conflicting motives, yet always consistently believable. In later years, Welles perfected his persona of larger-than-life bluster and wounded arrogance, on screen and off, but he never again got a chance to play a character of such complexity and nuance.

KANE's status as ""the greatest film ever made"" is always being challenged, defended and debated, yet it is remarkable how seldom the film itself is imitated. Despite being given this perfect blueprint for how to film a biography, it is rare that any film attempts to break free of the this-happened-that-happened style of storytelling. It is as if the legendary stature of the film intimidates others.

Hitchcock once said that film is life with all the dull parts edited out. Welles adheres to this and goes one better: CITIZEN KANE is all highlights and underlined passages, a Cliff Notes biography of sorts. Does this allow us to get to know the real Charles Foster Kane? Well, yes, and no. We are allowed to solve the mystery of ""Rosebud,"" but Kane the man remains just out of our reach. We never really meet Charles Foster Kane, only his shadows. Welles and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz give us pieces of a puzzle, but the pieces are not all from the same puzzle.",10/10,13 June 2005,majikstl,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Why the viewers of Citizen Kane are an essential part of the film,"Famously in the film Citizen Kane the title character Charles Foster Kane dies in his bed, muttering ""Rosebud"" and dropping a snow globe, without anybody other than Kane being visible in the room. Yet the whole film is based on the premise that ""Rosebud"" was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.

The film mostly is told to us (quite literally) from a subjective point of view and through opinions of people who knew Charles Foster Kane. And Kane was a different kind of person depending on who told the story. A main message of the film - so to speak - is that there is no actual picture of a person, there are just many different fragmented pictures of which none are true or false.

In the very first scene of the film we see a sign that says ""No Trespassing"". This sort of makes us the intruders to Xanadu and to Kane's life. The camera goes through his garden around the castle leading into the castle. So in the beginning we, like, become another one of those subjective witnesses who try to get the ""full picture"" and who eventually will form an opinion about this person. And to include the viewer into this bunch of unreliable witnesses and to manifest the concept that we are in the same position as all of those characters who told us THEIR story of Kane's life, the viewer obviously (for now) is the only witness to the first act of 'Citizen Kane' and the last chapter of Kane's life. It is this very event that gets the stone rolling. It makes us a witness and now the investigation of Kane's past life can begin.

Now if you think of the interviewer/reporter who asks the people for Kane's story, we mostly see him from behind with the camera looking over his shoulders. Or he is obscured by shadows, a hat and (observating) glasses. Often he simply is off-screen altogether and we apparently are the interviewees' only listeners. The poor man is pretty much faceless. One could say that the interviewer, who never is fleshed out as a character - if you can even call him a character with an own identity - is taking the position of the viewer who witnessed his last word and who wants to find out what it means.

You could look at it as an inside joke by Welles, that the very premise of the film is based on what initially looks like a goof. He waits until the last interview to tell us that the butler was actually in the room to witness the word, and now the film doesn't need us as witnesses anymore. We are done being witnesses, as now we have created our own individual image of Charles Foster Kane in our mind, based on everything we saw and heard. Maybe soon another viewer will trespass the the barriers of Xanadu, wondering who this man was. And this time he will walk up to us and ask us who Charles Foster Kane was, and we will be glad to tell him.

Pleased I watched it just so I know what people are talking about when they say ""well it's no citizen kane"", but I'll never watch it again.....

One of the Greats!,"Citizen Kane (1941): Dir: Orson Welles / Cast: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloane, Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead: Portrait of a wasted life full of luxury opening with Charles Foster Kane who whispers the word ""Rosebud."" With that he dies releasing an ornament that crashes to the floor such as his life. During his life he had alienated himself from everyone, focusing on a political career. Those who knew him are interviewed examining the meaning of his final words. Speculations evaporate into flashbacks to show his brief childhood to his introduction into the world of politics. Directed by Orson Welles who was only twenty-five when he directed this film, and its impact would render it his masterpiece. He also takes to acting and flawlessly portrays Kane through his adult life and mirrors his frustration and longing for the one thing he missed. Outstanding supporting work by Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloane who portray friends of Kane's who also worked with him, and both with different results career wise. Dorothy Comingore plays his mistress who grows tired and depressed until her only option is to leave. Agnes Moorehead plays Kane's mother who reluctantly makes the decision along with his father that ultimately affects his entire life. Brilliantly constructed with astonishing imagery and Welles revealing the big payoff in the final shot. Score: 10 / 10

"Well Done Movie, Epic Mystery, Many Other Pros, But Ultimately Not That Interesting Story","Okay. I watched this movie recently finally and totally understand why it's been praised so much.

To be honest though, the story didn't grab me that much. Yeah, the mystery itself was interesting, the characters were well written, the plot too. It was directed nicely and the cinematography was on a very good level. Overall, the movie is a good example on how a story should be told on the big screen.

"Tried it, just can't take it!","I have tried to watch this movie 3 times. Each time I promise myself that I will watch it through to see all the facinating camera angles and light shading. I want to see the last ten minutes of the film and be awed and amazed as I realize that Rosebud is something extraordinary. I want to recognize Mr. Wells' genius, daring, and inventivness. I want to feel the passion, emptiness, and all the other powerful emotions that the actors and ""unique"" cinematography portray in this movie.

I have not been able to make it yet. This is the single most boring hard to watch movie that I have ever tried to watch. I can usually watch about any movie at least once, but not this one.

I don't need exciting special effects, car chases, shoot outs, or sex scenes to keep me interested. I just need the movie to be interesting. This film is not interesting to me. I love history and I watch many older movies and I appreciate most of them for what they are, and in the time frame that they were made. But this one is just very hard to watch. If you have to have a college professor,(who himself has had to read a book about it to understand it) explain a movie to you so that you can appreciate it, then I'm sorry folks but then it just ""ain't good"".

I have enjoyed thousands of movies, and I have disliked many also, but very few have I never been able to finish watching and this is one of them.",1/10,5 May 2004,guy_r,Citizen Kane (1941),NEGATIVE
Nothing like it....,"When it comes to Citizen Kane, one question eclipses all others: Is it the best film ever made? The answer, for me anyway, is yes.

Citizen Kane is still easily THE greatest films ever made. Its not 'one of', or 'the second', its the FINEST. I don't think any film will ever over-shadow it, either. Its one of the most famous, as it (successfully) broke every cinematic boundary in the book. It introduced countless innovations that are today a common part of film-making.

The movie opens with an unforgettable image of a distant, fog-shrouded castle on a hill. It's a classic Gothic shot, and goes a long way towards establishing Citizen Kane's mood. We quickly learn that this place, called Xanadu, is the dwelling of America's Kubla Khan, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a one-time newspaper magnate who could have become President if not for an ill-advised extramarital affair. Xanadu, in the words of the faux newsreel that gives a brief history of Kane's life, is the ""costliest monument of a man to himself."" Any resemblance to The Ranch, William Randolph Hearst's real-life San Simeon abode, is not coincidental.

In the opening, Kane is dead, and utters the word 'rosebud' as he hunches over. His death, like his life, is a big news event, and the paper he owned, the New York Inquirer, is desperate to unearth the meaning of his cryptic last word. Is it a woman he bedded? A horse he bet on? A beloved pet? Some long-lost, unrequited love? The truth, which isn't revealed until the closing scene, represents one of the all-time greatest motion picture ironies, and leads us to believe that, on some level, Kane regretted not having led a simple, quiet life. A ten minuet newsreel follows this to exhibit his larger-than-life accomplishments.

After this, reporters and the public in general, begin to investigate what he actually meant by 'rosebud'. The film dips into flashbacks (in chronology), to search for 'rosebud's significance. It also shows interviews with his loved (and loathed) ones, to see if they have any inkling to what it may mean.

The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since. Every image is depicted with incredible detail, and beauty.

There's no doubt that Citizen Kane is far ahead of its time. Uncompromising, unsentimental drama of this sort was not in vogue during an era that was better known for titles like The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and How Green Was My Valley (which beat out Kane for best picture).

Not only is this film-making at its best, but motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema.",10/10,20 October 2007,Uliabes,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
A lot less heavy than I expected,"I went into this knowing of its great reputation, but fearing it would be very slow and boring with a lot of dialogue and a heavy 'moral message'. Although it did have an underlying message (and a very strong and well made one too), the film wasn't at all what I expected; the camera work and music in particular livened it up, and at times it was quite light hearted. I think this helped make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. It kept me gripped all the way, and I don't have a long attention span. The acting throughout is superb, with very little of the overacting that you might expect from this period, with Welles in particular giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. My advice is give it a try, even if you think it's not your type of film.

The Best Film Ever?,"The BFI top 50 films list was dominated by one film for 50 years. That film, was ""Citizen Kane"". Any film that tops a critically acclaimed list, deserves a watch. I can say without a doubt that this film is one of the most compelling and stylishly executed motion pictures I have ever viewed.

As for my title, ""The Best Film Ever?"", I truly believe if there is one film that rises above the others I have viewed it must be this one, there is something so unique and tidy about the way this film has been put together and shot, it is full of iconic shot's that when you watch them you will want to pause the film and just stop and stare with delight at the beauty of the camera work and the perfect acting that is being displayed within the shot.

The plot of Citizen Kane consists of a young boy, Charles Foster Kane, who has been rejected by his parents and is given away to live with a rich, money grabbing politician who is very wealthy. Charles runs into this wealth and also becomes the head of a newspaper company named, ""The Inquirer"". Charles changes the whole system of the newspaper and how they fill their papers. Charles transforms the paper and makes it much more politically competitive with the other papers, this draws attention to the Inquirer as well as drawing attention to Charles himself. Charles then runs for governor and displays a powerful speech which consists of some tremendous acting and is surrounded by some iconic scenery which is lead by a large poster of Kane which stuck in my mind because of its wonderful vastness. Everything looks good for Kane until his affair, (so to speak), is discovered by an opposing governor candidate. When this story gets out, Kane's chances of becoming governor deteriorate and this starts Kane's spiral of self destruction and in time drives him into his grief hole which he calls ""Xanadu"". He goes to live there with his wife who he lost his chances of governor for and slowly becomes a more miserable weaker man.

The second side of the plot is a lot shorter but is a key part of the film. It starts when there is a shot of Kane, (At this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words, ""Rosebud"", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the wood floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's acquaintances to find out what rosebud could possibly mean, the conversation's between the journalist and Kane's acquaintances turn into flashbacks which structure the whole film wonderfully and create an entertaining unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to appreciate if not enjoy immensely.

My verdict on this film is pretty much summed up by the title, the film is structured unlike any other films in its time period and is assisted superbly by consistent, powerful and distinct acting that when viewed will impress anybody who is a lover of films and also appeals to people who are used to watching films that maybe are not so acclaimed, I am instructing you now, do not be hesitant to watch this film, it is almost impeccable and thoroughly entertaining.

""Whatever I do, I do because I love you"", from me, Kane receives a 10.",10/10,24 September 2012,bilsborrow23,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Deserves to be a great film.,"If you see a 50 years old film and still find the cinematography and other film making techniques to be compelling than just imagine the impact it would have over the audience in those times. From the start I found it to be a visual treat. Over the first few minutes it runs as if you are sitting in a local train and which stops at different stations and you get to know the glimpses of your journey. Such is the great editing which is used in the starting.

The story telling manner was completely unorthodox and has blown my mind. What is more important to note is the character of Charles Kane. The film has depicted his character in such a way that the audience is in a confused state as to what truly was his nature. I like films which make people guessing and thinking when they leave the Cinema Hall. The acting of the director himself was awesome and other characters also performed very nicely. In all, this is a film which will leave you thinking about it all the time obviously making you guess the different aspects of the story. Any cinema lover is sure to enjoy this.

PROS:

The story of the film is brilliantly written and the character of Charles Kane has been analyzed with full depth. What is more compelling to me is that analysis of the character done in the film is from the point of the view of the director and the writer. But it also leaves space for the audience to make their own version of this character. Such great is its depiction. No doubt that the cinematography and editing are at their best. To understand how great the techniques are, you have to get out of the world of films that we are living in currently. Only than one can truly understand what is great. Orson has given the best acting in the film as the lead character. The only other one whom I would compare here would be Francois Truffaut and his acting in the film Day for Night. The progress of the story, the depth of the nature of the important characters and their part in the film are satisfying to the maximum level.

CONS:

In the middle however I got drifted away a little from the film but that might be because I was carrying too much of expectation from the film and was expecting it to be as compelling as The Bicycle Thief but I understand that both of them are of a different genre. And maybe we should never carry too much expectation because when we do so than our mind makes us to find faults in the act we are going to perform. But the pleasing editing again took me into the film.

MESSAGE: ""Truth is bitter.""

Excellent,"This is possibly the best motion picture ever made! It holds you outside and keeps you inside at the same time. Made in 1941, and without the greatest cast, this film is telling the story of a newspaperman before and after his death.

Talking about the cast: The movies three main female parts, played by Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead and Ruth Warrick, all playing a Kane, are doing unforgettable roles, and I wonder why none of them became real stars after this fantastic performance. The story is classical without being boring or ""I've-seen-it-before-like"". You will soon forget that this is a b/w-picture! You will find the colors inside!

The Acting is incredible, with every performances unique and perfect. The Direction is flawless. The Cinematography is perfect. The Art is Impeccable. The Sound is Incredible. The Editing it is Revolutionary in its own way. Many of the novel techniques Welles developed with the cinematographer were calculated to offer new angles on film space. Everything that has something to do with this film is a masterpiece. The Story is a major hit, with an amazing plot and a strong argument, This Film is a Masterpiece, is truly one of the best films out there, certainly a high point in early cinema. and every award that it get its well deserved.

"""Kane"" vs. ""Intolerance""","I was disappointed. A work of art should be viewed as a whole. So, besides its ground-breaking techniques, which are brilliant, this film seems to me not to ""get together"". There is something over-ambitious in it, surpassing the actors' and (don't shoot) perhaps even Welles' possibilities at the time. The story is simple, the characters are sketchy and motivation-lacking, and the ""Rosebud"" search reminds me of the melodramatic search for the Immortal Beloved in Bernard Rose's film (lame, I know), but fortunately it remained a mystery. With all that hype about the ""greatest film ever"" (???), it's too easy to be disappointed about ""Kane"". And speaking of technical aspects, why not equally praise Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (1916)? Me, at least, I do so.

A Masterpiece,"The first time I watched Citizen Kane, while I appreciated the technical advancements and its influence on film in general, and while I thought the film was fantastic, I didn't really believe it to be the film to end all films in the aspects of character, plot, and entertainment. However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of ""Classics"" that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.

Everything about the movie made me feel something. There were scenes filled with energy, filled with emptiness, filled with tragedy, it really does take you through the full scope of such a successful man's life, and even though Charles Foster Kane himself can sometimes be arrogant, egotistical, and downright terrible, you don't feel justice when he fails. You feel sympathy. But why? Because in the end, through his ups and downs, he's a human being. He has emotions, he has flaws, he has likable traits, he's extremely fleshed out throughout the film, and while he may not be the most enjoyable, suave, or likable character, he certainly is one of the best in film history.

Another thing I feel is worth discussing is the ending. Everybody knows it, thanks to Family Guy feeling it was humorous to spoil it for no other reason just to do so, as well as basically every review mentioning it. So don't go any further unless you already seen the film. So, throughout the film, news reporters are eager to find the meaning to a famous millionaire's final word, ""Rosebud"" (Which before anyone throws that plot-hole in my face, I just go with the theory that he said it loud enough for the nurse outside to hear). At first, they believe it's a girl, possibly one of the many that he's dated throughout his life. This is understandable, as the millionaire, Mr. Kane, is famous for being around women.

However, in the end, Rosebud is not a woman, or anything anyone thought it would be. Rosebud was in fact, his childhood sled. Earlier in the film, we see Charles as a young boy, with his sled, which at this point, we don't know its name. Charles is taken away from his mother at a young age to get an education, leaving his sled, his home, and his childhood behind.

His parents had sent Charles away to become rich, and leave behind his poverty in which he grew up in. However, as Charles dies, he looks into a snow-globe, and with his final word, he remembers a time in which he was truly happy. Sure, he became rich and famous, but it would be entirely possible that in the end, he would have been happier if they decided to just let him play in the snow.

So in the final scene, you see the sled thrown into a fire, merely junk in everyone's eyes. It was an old sled to them, but to Charles Foster Kane, it symbolized loss of innocence, similar to Lord of the Flies, with the children becoming barbaric, mimicking the world they lived in, and by the end, they cry for the loss of their innocence, as instead of being shielded from the violence like the evacuation intended, they embraced it.

Orson Welles is fantastic, displaying power and greed, but also bolstering an ego. He also did a good job depicting the different ages of his character, with his make-up helping as well. The other actors do a great job as well, and while some of them were a bit hammy, it definitely matched the personalities of the characters they were portraying.

I could go on and on about what makes the film fantastic, the film is shot gorgeously, with both the camera-work and the sets matching the mood of the scene, the editing is extremely modern and keeps the film flowing at a good pace, and the film knows when music should be played, and when the scene should be silent, something a lot of films from the 30's and 40's fail at doing. But in the end, it would just be me reinstating how fantastic the film is, which I really don't think should be repeated, as I believe you get the picture by this point.

So, is this my favorite film? Well, it's tough to say, but I think it's just barely worse than Lawrence of Arabia, though that may have been for the bird scene in Citizen Kane, which, like the car scene in Tarkovsky's Solaris, it felt like a fourth wall gimmick to me. But when I'm comparing a film to something like Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard to come up with favorites. I guess that's why I list off my favorites rather than usually picking one. But I'm getting off topic here. Citizen Kane is a powerhouse of a film, the type of film that doesn't happen often, but the type of film that not only inspires all to come, but still manages, among the clichés it creates and amount of people who have the film spoiled for them, to remain fresh and new to all who watch it.

"Worthy of respect, but people have since done similar things better","""Citizen Kane"" is most certainly a landmark film over a variety of fields: cinematography, plot structure, acting, content and countless others that I can't recall as of now. It is certainly a visually spectacular film and its method of using a frame narrative to tell someone's life story is worthy of note/praise. Yet to be quite honest, I don't think that ""Citizen Kane"" otherwise really stands as a particularly intriguing film. Its pace is quite slow and too much of the film concerns itself on Kane's romances. I understand that it is worthy of respect, but I can't help but think that people are being a bit pretentious when labelling it as the GREATEST film of all time. As good as it may be, it certainly won't ever be in my Top 10.

Deeply disappointing,"I'm afraid this film did nothing for me. It is sadly over hyped and not worthy of all the praise it has received. I forced myself to watch this film but it was a struggle to engage with the plot. Like a few other people have said, it might have great cinematography for the time it was made, but lacks that crucial ingredient - entertainment! I can chalk it off as being seen but won't be waking another two hours watching it a second time. I don't think I'm alone in disliking this movie. There are films that deserve high ratings on imdb but this isn't one of them. I hope more people take the time to give this the raspberry award it truly deserves.

How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? To the film itself!,"How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious: either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility: the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to ""die Sache selbst"". I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.

But enough about all the preparations. To the film itself! Was I touched by the film? Yes I was. In fact at times I was touched deeply by it, more than I remembered from the last time. Especially by some of the scenes with Kane's wife in the opera house and the scenes in Xanadu, where the true nature of their relationship was revealed. But is Kane a manipulative film? Yes it is. I think that Orson Welles perhaps suffered from many of the same faults as Kane himself, like Leland said: ""You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules."" Citizen Kane is a film that self-consciously wants to be loved. No, it demands to be loved, to be taken before anything else. Very, very hard work went into the making of it to ensure this. It avoids extremities and one-sidedness so as not to exclude any viewers. It includes beautiful and innovative shots in order to appeal to critics and formalist, but mostly not so obvious as to become elitist. It tries to be deep, profound and mysterious and takes itself dead-serious. There was one scene that didn't touch me as much this time, even if it did before, and that was the Rosebud scene at the beginning: it was so intensely self-serious that for a fraction of a second it went over the top for me and became almost comical, like a self-parody (and the fake mustache didn't really help there). But mostly the film is absolutely perfect in terms of editing, narrative and dramatic development, composition, cinematography and an undefinable feel of greatness and precision permeating almost every shot that can only be the product of extremely hard labor and loads of talent. There were also less than perfect qualities, such as the somewhat slower development of the middle part, the acting that varied from great to constructed, even from Welles himself. Also the atmosphere is strange: mostly the film smells like newspapers, money and power-grabbing. Of course that is what the film is about, but as an atmosphere that is normally not really a virtue. Still, this dry and somewhat suffocating atmosphere becomes part of the tragedy of the film, just like the fact that the film is just as manipulative as Citizen Kane himself, becomes part of that tragedy and actually deepens it. Just by not succeeding to create a beautiful atmosphere, the film tragically makes us wish to be released from it and makes us yearn for something lost. Just by the fact that it tries to manipulate us, tries to pull our strings too hard, and fails to touch our hearts because of it, the film becomes the very deadness and emptiness that sends chills down our spine, from the top of our heads, straight to our hearts. 10/10",9/10,8 March 2013,AukeBriek,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Welles' masterpiece,"Well I finally watched it, the so-called ""greatest movie of all time"". Does it deserve the praise? Yes. Is it the greatest film of all time? I wouldn't go that far. Its eclipsed for me by other classics like Casablanca, Taxi Driver, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. But Citizen Kane is absolutely a great film, telling the story of one of the most famous characters of cinema history.

Citizen Kane opens, as we all know, with the passing of a titan. Whispering ""Rosebud"", Kane passes into the void and his snow globe shatters. Journalists desperately try to come up with a tribute that does not just retell his life but rather peels back the layers to expose the man within. With just the word ""rosebud"" to go off, journalist Jerry Thompson seeks out Kane's guardian, friend, co-worker, ex-wife and butler to conduct interviews that might reveal what ""rosebud"" means and that it might give a clue as to who Kane was. The film is shot in flashbacks with these interviews, a story technique I don't particularly care for but works essentially with the framing of the story and the mystery of Rosebud.

Citizen Kane breathes on two superb aspects, the first being Gregg Toland's breathtaking cinematography. Welles and Toland also orchestrate one of the most widely used and effective tools – shooting powerful characters from below and weak characters from above to diminish them. The only time this doesn't work is when in the final scenes, we can see Welles' prosthetic mask under his chin that would have been easier to hide with a different angle. Moreover, I am stunned by the fact that Citizen Kane contains some of the most perfect shots of all cinema history – Kane walks past a mirror, reflecting himself countless times out; the way the camera zooms in Kane's speech but manages never to lose frame on that iconic Kane for Governor poster in the background; Thompson sits down to read an archive with the light beaming in from a small window – I could just list them all. The last shot, a retreating camera over the clutter of Kane's estate, then the reveal of Rosebud's fate before a cut to black smoke spewing from his chimney is a masterpiece of reveal, camera-work and editing – and even thought I've seen it a dozen times on Youtube clips, it sent chills through my entire body.

The other aspect is Welles' magnetic performance as Kane. Welles himself was 25 when he made the movie – which you would never believe because he carries gravitas of a man twice his age with ten times the life experience. There is only one scene in which Welles plays his own age, and he does it with a youthful glint in his eye, but in the later scenes he carries the same sort of powerful presence that we expect from esteemed actors like Sir Daniel Day- Lewis or Sir Ian McKellen. The makeup team does probably the finest work I've ever seen in a film, ever. Kane's rage is palpable, his drive profound, and during one scene his sense of loss is affecting by the void we feel in his performance. Welles captures so perfectly the emotionally hollow man that Kane was, always seeking approval from others because he grew up distant from his parents. In one very telling scene, his son waves excitedly and Kane responds with a polite salute rather than anything warmer.

Citizen Kane's screenplay is a deserving representative of the film at the Oscars, with scenes like his disastrous run for Governor worthy of commendation in their own right. I could probably have done without most of the first twelve minutes, which is little more than an expository summary of the movie condensed for the paper's eulogy. It only sought to highlight also how skimmed over Kane's first wife was – their marriage consists only of a few back-and-forth scenes at the dinner table. She and their young son vanish from the film and without the opening montage I'd never know why. The other problems I have with the film are just problems of a past era of film – characters talk over each other, people hold phone conversations but don't pause long enough for the other person to speak, and people shout all the time because film was still in its early years.

None of that is to take away from Orson Welles' masterful film. His performance is one for the ages and some of the techniques in making the film should be used to teach new recruits to the industry. However, the thing I found fascinating was that in the closing credits, Welles gives every actor their due but slides himself into the extended cast list. Whether he was being humble about his performance or something else entirely, I found it fascinating.

Also, suck it Lisa – there totally is a cane in Citizen Kane. He carries it on the street when he meets his second wife.

One of the greatest films of all time - beautifully shot and directed,"Many critics and fans alike regard Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to see how that endearing reputation has befitted its audacious production for so many decades. In experiencing the film on Blu-ray (the 70th Anniversary Edition, to be exact), the film holds up magnificently well through the innovative and distinctive structure, make-up/visual effects, and lighting employed by Orson and his team all those years ago.

Citizen Kane, of course, was the directorial debut of Orson Welles, whose booming and authoritative voice had made a him career in radio after co-founding the Mercury Theatre with John Houseman in 1937. By 1938, they created the Mercury Theatre on Air which would showcase their famous reading of the H.G. Wells classic, 'War of the Worlds,' a prank many took serious upon first hearing. Eventually, RKO Radio Pictures would grant Welles total freedom to make any picture he wanted; needless to say, Citizen Kane was born and became the darling it now is with both critics and fans around the world. While the picture did lose RKO money initially, the financial loss says nothing of its considerable contribution to cinema.

The film is known for its incredibly poetic composition, deep focus, and nonlinear storytelling, which I must say, allows revisiting the picture to be a much more pleasurable experience since one is always trying to dissect all these wonderfully visual elements. Much of this credit should go to cinematographer Gregg Toland, whose use of 'deep focus,' a terrific technique whereby the back and foregrounds are equally in focus, became essential in giving Citizen Kane its unique and often-times deceptive appearance. Toland of course won the Academy Award for cinematography for William Wyler's 'Wuthering Heights' the year prior, and would subsequently assist Welles in making a picture that allowed the audience themselves to decide the importance of what was on screen without obvious dictation from the director or crew. So many of these incredible shots allow for plenty of clever effects and underlining of character foreshadowing as the story moves along.

The acting is also a remarkable standout, in particular Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom were friends with Welles from his Mercury Theatre on the Air radio crew, as were most of the actors in the film, in fact. The latter however - the stunningly enigmatic Agnes Moorehead - is my favorite performance of the entire picture. There's such a restraint and composure to her character that goes unmatched by anyone else. Sadly, she has less screen time than her co-stars, but this of course makes her no less effective in my view. Her performance is so boldly pronounced that she alone is responsible for quickly hooking the audience into the story of young Charles Foster Kane; we cannot help but want to learn of what happens to this young man through seeing his mother portrayed so fearlessly in such an important context of the movie. Bernard Herrmann's music is also a grand addition to the picture, loaning its duties to all sorts of emotions - drama, comedy, suspense; he even supplies an original aria for one of Kane's opera- singing mistresses. It's a fantastic, widespread composition for which brings a lot of weight to Welles' vision. The Blu-ray of course is great and features the stunning, Academy Award-nominated documentary, The Battle for Citizen Kane, along with commentaries and other features. It's definitely worth upgrading from the DVD and I urge anyone who has yet to see this film to purchase it immediately.

Citizen Kane is a fine example of how motion pictures can establish themselves as true art and what young filmmakers should focus on as an influence over their own productions. Let us not forget those who laid these tracks before us; they surely lead back to some magnificent places, don't they?",10/10,1 September 2015,LowellFan09,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Remarkable!,"I can see why this movie is on the top of everyone's lists; I can't stop thinking about it! ""Citizen Kane is rich with symbolism, layers upon layers of meaning and incredible cinematography. From Kane's death bed utterance to the final scene I was spellbound! I keep thinking about why Kane did what he did, who he was trying to replace with all the life size statues he brought back from Europe and what Kane's life might have looked like if his parents didn't send him packing for a neat $50,000 a year. My interpretation of Citizen Kane is this: the man, Charles Foster Kane seeks desperately to replace his mother who sent him away as a young boy but no amount of expensive statuary can replace the love he was denied as a child. His youth went up in smoke just as all his childhood treasures in the movie's final scene. A must see film, not only is the story thought provoking, the camera work, lighting and each frame from the film is a treasure.

Is it as Good at the Hype? Almost,"In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words ""rosebud"" as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting.

My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.

Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.

The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.

In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion.",10/10,13 December 2014,pleamon111,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"""Rosebud.""","Without subtitles I thought that Charles Foster Kane had said ""frostbite"". In the opening minute I almost thought I was watching a horror movie, the way the cinematographer went from one scene to another, aided by the fact that Xanadu looked haunted.

The trivia for ""Citizen Kane"" was some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read. Orson Welles wrote and acted the character of Charles Foster Kane superbly well, and I suppose also did well directing himself. If this movie does anything, it is displaying yellow journalism and corrupted almost-politicians. Only Charles Foster Kane would think it ""fun"" to run a newspaper. At times Kane appears to be the man he wants people to think he is: a loving, kind, honest man, who would fit better than any other eligible man as the governor. Thanks to his friends, we brutally discover the true man underneath the layer of fake skin: a selfish, heartless man who only has one true goal in life: success, which he believes will also bring him happiness. But success cannot buy happiness, which he seemingly doesn't find out until his final dying moments.

This movie was definitely not one of my ""Great Movies"", as it was Ebert's. As interesting as this movie was, the thing that nagged at my mind the most was the fact that, if he died when he was alone, how does anyone know what his final words were? Somehow, amazingly, this thought apparently never did occur to Welles or any of the other cast, crew, or producers until after it was released, whereas it occurred to me within ten minutes, as I'm sure it did to many other viewers. Did Ebert himself miss this fact, even after hundreds of viewings, or somehow shrug it off, even after doing an audio commentary on it? Perhaps I can see how he shrugged it off, considering I have done the same on other movies I've enjoyed, though the problems were less obvious and less important to the plot.

This movie seems almost documentary-style, first giving us a summary of his life, then going back and addressing each plot point in more detail. The movie's strong points were the directing, characterization, and cinematography, and Welles' acting, although the other actors were quite disappointing. The movie was interesting and fun to watch, and the mystery kept us intrigued, although it was not quite what I was expecting. Charles Foster Kane was a very entertainingly arrogant character, and quite an incredible debut for Orson Welles. The end reveal is fascinating and meaningful in itself.

My Official Score: 89.5/100",9/10,14 September 2015,pioneerlythere37,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Citizen Kane,"Orson Welles, much like Alfred Hitchcock, is a fantastic director of horror, mysterious, and crime films. I've known of Orson Welles but have never seen any of his movies until this one and it definitely left me wanting to watch more of his films. This movie is a mystery-drama about news reporters trying to figure out what Charles Kane, a wealthy publisher's last words. The plot was well written and I found it to be entertaining to watch. I could not stop thinking and wanting to know what Kane's last words had meant, this keeps the viewers intrigued and not want to take their eyes off of the screen. It's said by many that this is the greatest movie ever; it is also said that it is extremely overrated. I found this movie to be very good especially given the time period it was made and I do think that people need to see this movie at least once in their life to get a feel of Welles' best works.

"Non-chronological history of the ups and downs in the life of Charles Foster Kane, based on the character of Randolph Hearst","""Citizen Kane,"" released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.

The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was ""rosebud."" The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word.

""March of the News,"" a satire of the theater weekly ""Time Marches On"" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the ""castle"" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.

As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of ""Bewitched"" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through.

The shot of a portrait of the newsmen of ""The Chronicle"" dissolves into a shot of his new ""Inquirer"" staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original some about Charle Kane.

Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings.

He treats his wives like another of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.

Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. ""All he ever wanted was love,"" recollects Jedidiah as an old man.

We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.

Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the ""working man."" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. ""A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,"" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.

Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. ""Some kind of friend he is,"" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.

Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his coliseum.

As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator. Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?",7/10,6 November 2005,Writer228,Citizen Kane (1941),NEGATIVE
A great movie from finish to start to finish!,"Although Citizen Kane was intended to make fun of William Randolph Hearst and his lavish ways of living, the movie nevertheless shines. It has every element a classic film has: romance, mystery, adventure, and even a little bit of thriller/horror.

Unlike many movies, I could feel the same emotions as the character. Because the acting is so well done (with maybe a few cheesy sections), Citizen Kane is very convincing.

I admire how you can never see the faces of some of the characters. That was done on purpose to convey that these characters were not very important.

The dialogue is very succinct and unique. No other movie could have such clever screenplay. Of course, ""rosebud"" is the most famous line out of the movie, but the way the characters respond to each other is irreplaceable.

The flashback is very gradual so that it is not confusing. I am very fortunate that I don't have to waste energy trying to follow along.

I find it interesting how Orson Welles tried some new filming techniques. He used camera angles to show dominance, deliberately put actors in danger, and made sets very detailed and elaborate. In fact, he was one of the few directors at the time to have a ceiling.

Although the first time I saw Citizen Kane was in a high school videography class, I still felt like I was in a theater, enjoying the classics that some people never notice.",9/10,6 September 2012,alexis-368-973240,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Great style without much feeling,"First of all, having been told that this film is the greatest of all time for many years is bound to disappoint first time viewers. And complaining that a film is over-rated is a complaint of the critics and scholars, not of the film itself.

But while it's clearly a tour-de-force of screenwriting, direction, and visual style, I've always felt that there's something missing: emotional impact.

It's certainly a well-told yarn, but there are very few moments that make you feel emotionally connected to, or empathetic with, any of the characters. The film makes me marvel at its stylish panache, but it never really makes me feel anything.

Without that emotional connection, it feels like a trailblazing achievement for its time, but not a great work of cinematic art.

Overrated. Waste of time.,"This movie was seen under my pledge to finish any movie I had started. Otherwise I would not have finished it. Back in 1941 when it was first released, perhaps people had not much else to watch...and so they were surprised by a mysterious film. But we are now in 2018, and I can assure you, there is nothing entertaining in thei 2 hour movie. Nevertheless, I am glad I saw it, so that I can judge the people who claim it is a masterpiece as people of little taste.....in my opinion. You have been warned.

Exceeded expectations and then some!,"As someone who's seen plenty of excellent modern films, I expected Citizen Kane's greatness to strongly depend on historic innovations rather than truly timeless quality. But after watching it in my film course this week, I immediately recognized why it has been touted by many (including famous film critic Roger Ebert) as nothing less than the best piece of cinema to ever grace the silver screen.

Orson Welles and his team left no stone unturned in their quest to fill every scene with clever camera-work, intelligent blocking, smooth editing and... well the list goes on and on. Right from the first scene, where you are embraced with the cold and dark tone of the movie through creatively plastered-together shots of the ominous Kane castle, you know you are in for something special. Something that I don't normally notice in contemporary movies but I picked up on in this one is the lighting. The lighting in this film is practically another character, and this in and of itself is something to be in awe of. I can't imagine the amount of time, effort and talent it required to craft something so precisely beautiful. I feel like a sap going on like this but Citizen Kane truly is a masterclass in filmmaking.

I went into this movie expecting a dull experience with decent technical aspects and cheesy performances but left it with a whole new mindset on what makes a good film and what makes a good filmmaker. If you're a terrible cinephile like me who is reluctant to watch the 1940s classics, I strongly recommend giving this a watch.",10/10,9 February 2016,Anthony_Miller,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
A true masterpiece. A real lesson to every cinematographer,"Orson Welle's Citizen Kane is one of the best films ever made. The state-of-the-art techniques and the clever plot make this film unforgettable, even though the narrative has some flaws with its pace. For us, Rosebud is the name of the sleigh with which Kane hit Thatcher when he was little. It's a name of change, a very important name in his life. It dies with Kane because it is actually him. For Thompson, Rosebud will be another piece of a jigsaw puzzle he could never find. But the viewer is redeemed through all the things they learnt from Kanes life all these years. And as the final scene shows us with the flaming Rosebud, life goes on.

Classic,"A movie of epic proportions is how I would describe Citizen Kane. I have watched this film a couple of times, expecting not to like it as much as I would. Being a movie that gets a lot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.

Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.

And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.

And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.

After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.",10/10,11 March 2013,Sonic_Ocean,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE

"Not my favourite film ever, but still a wonderful experience 75 years after the fact!","I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.

As you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.",10/10,12 April 2016,talisencrw,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
The Aurora Borealis of Cinema,"Began seeing this film in snippets running in and out of the house between playing baseball in the backyard and heading back down into the basement with Cool-Aid and tuna fish sandwiches to sit on the couch and watch this thing on our black and white T.V. Sooner or later, it would be on the Bill Kennedy show and he would look into his files for newspaper footage about it. The thing that's so wonderful is how accessible this film is for being touted by some as 'the greatest of all time'. Whether or not that is so is more than I know. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of great films. Anything that I might say would barely add or subtract to what has already been said and would probably prove to be redundant at best, so I'll just make a few personal observations and let it go at that.

CITIZEN KANE is like a Magic Box filled with all these independent features of interest. Barely coming in under two hours it seems much longer than that and compares favorably with other epics that require an intermission somewhere between its three hours or more length. That's the first thing I have to say about it; the way it seems to dilate time and yet is over before you know it. You don't even have to see the thing from beginning to end to enjoy it. Some years passed before I actually sat down and saw this piece in its entirety. But it didn't seem to matter. There is something ubiquitous about it; it will be there for you when you get the time to fully appreciate it. As a kid, the film noir beginning made me wonder whether or not this was a horror story or some kind of detective tale. As most people know, the truth is it is both and more than that.

Agnes Moorehead never looked better in her life! Joseph Cotton along with the rest of the Mercury Theater come on strong in this tale.

There are many who will compare this film to THE GODFATHER or VERTIGO and there is probably much to be gained from this, but looking at the film from the inside out you feel yourself having access to one of the most liberal minds of all time. There is a strong spirit of inventiveness here where Welles as the auteur is not adapting his tale to the strictures of Film, but rather adapting the strictures of Film to this vision of grand sweeping storytelling. This to me is what separates it from other great films that it can be compared and discussed with. For most cinematic works, technique is subservient to the story; and yet in CITIZEN KANE it feels as though technique is subservient to the inventiveness of its creator. I'm sure this is true in some Hitchcock films and of course the films of Ingmar Bergman and others, but here that sense of inventiveness is less coldly calculated as it is with Hitchcock at his best, nor is it as somber and steeped in religious and philosophical overtones as it is with Bergman at his most profound. The inventiveness of Welles here is youthful and exuberant and in a naive sort of way distinctly American. Gangway! The young Turks have come to town! Clear the floor for some hoofin' and break out the champagne!

I say naive because there is something unselfconscious about this modern classic. Welles is too busy having fun to worry about posterity right now, he'll get back to you later concerning all that. I'll never forget the scene with the dance hall girls. After a bit of cinematic legerdemain where we see Kane buy off the whole staff of a rival newspaper and frame them for a news photograph, we then find his own people joining in to sing his praises. As a youngster the thing that startled me was how long this scene went on; Welles didn't seem to be doing this scene to serve the story particularly, but just for the sheer thrill of dancing with the ladies and having fun! The exhilaration of this scene was something that has stayed with me all my life. Some kind of energy seemed to spiral out of the screen and shake you by the shoulders and urge you to take one spin around yourself. Come on! There's enough booze and food for everyone! It's this scene that makes me wish that Welles had chosen the life of Babe Ruth to chronicle rather than that of William Randolph Hearst.

But it doesn't stop there. When you hear Welles present Kane as an orator you are seeing a spellbinder at work; you will see this side of Welles again in MOBY DICK and perhaps more importantly, in the final scenes of the film COMPULSION. This is the energy and passion of a young man at the height of his powers. Kane for President! He'll fight for the common people and win us our rights!

Eventually, due to poor choices and a marked propensity to love the power that his wealth brings him more than the people he supposedly wishes to champion, we see Kane progress towards his inevitable slide into tragedy. This is handled with sophistication and taste and we see how Kane becomes an embittered worn out old man living a shallow existence among the shadows of the things that he owns.

In the end, we are given a glimpse of insight into the character of Kane that is denied all the other characters in the film. But even that is just an echo of what Everett Sloan as Bernstein tells the reporter Jerry about the girl he saw crossing over on the Ferry. Soon even this is just so much smoke drifting up above the chain link fence and the NO TRESPASSING sign in front of Xanadu...

Narrative and Eye Disconnect,"Spoilers Herein.

This an extremely influential film, by one of the very few inventors of cinema. But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)

First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.

Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.

The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.

The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.

The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.

Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.

But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.

But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure.

"Certainly a classic, but over-hyped for my tastes","The elegance and production quality of this film are absolutely stunning and flawless for the time. The plot and storyline, however, left much to be desired to me, as they were slow developing and not as exciting as I had hoped. The extensive length of the movie also hindered how I felt about the overall quality of the film. My negative criticisms of the film aside, I do still believe that this film is deserving of the high praise and prestige that it receives and is known for. Overall this movie was an excellent masterpiece that was well designed, put together, and thought out, unfortunately, it was just not to my tastes and I could not enjoy it like most people did.

I tried hating this movie,"When I first saw Citizen Kane, I hated it. Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie. Don't look at it as the best movie, just look at it as a movie, and maybe you'll appreciate it more. Greatest Movie of All Time? Yeah, it's kind of hard not to like it?",10/10,19 October 2012,ChristophCinema,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
Life through a snow globe,"It would be difficult at best to contribute any insight in what might be the most analyzed movie of all time. So I think I'd like to just give my initial impressions of this film after seeing it for the first time in over a decade. This is a hauntingly powerful work. This is a film that many will relate to and revisit mentally. The strength of the film lies in the writing. The unique way in which the story is revealed and the smart believable dialog. The technical aspects are also unique and the use of light is superb. It's one of the best and certainly one of the first. Some of these images will sear themselves through your eyes into your brain. Orson shows his story telling and visionary talent in this piece. He was well beyond his time which is why his peers booed this film multiple times during the academy awards. It's looks as though Orsen had the last laugh as this one time art house film becomes one of the films against which all others are measured.

Very overrated,"Let me start of by saying that I understand that this movie was important when it was released, and that it had great influence, and I respect it for that. I found it extremely dull though, I can't believe people claim this is the best movie ever made. It sure isn't. I would probably have fallen asleep if it had not been for the hope that it would come up with something of interest before ending. I might as well have fallen asleep though, cause not much happened. I watch a lot of movies, and I don't mind artsy or unsual ones, like El Topo, Breaking The Waves, Santa Sangre, Satyricon etc. Citizen Kane completly failed to interest me though, and even though it's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, I would not even dream of calling it the best.

Cinematography At It's Best Form,"Citizen Kane is a movie that considered as the number 1 best film ever made in history from so many movie professionals. Firstly i even didn't believe it in any such way. Then i try to watch it. Wow, Citizen Kane was indisputable. I didn't need to contemplate carefully to make a statement that Citizen Kane was the best movie ever made. Cinematography that Welles use exalted by so many directors nowadays. It teach the next generation about what a true cinematography is. Welles is an inspirator of film directors.

The difficulties to make Citizen Kane was extremely high. Maybe the hardest film ever made in history. The shadows and lighting direction implementation was absolutely triumphant. The camera set- piece, positioning, and movement was indisputably genius. I can't compare the geniusity of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane to anybody. This was a true maximum potential of cinematography in movie history. If we ask which movie have the best cinematography ever, of course it was Citizen Kane.",9/10,24 April 2016,the-fearless-america,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
"The Enduring Legacy of ""Citizen Kane""","""Citizen Kane,"" directed by Orson Welles, is often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, and for good reason. Released in 1941, the film challenges the traditional narrative structure and technical conventions of its time, offering a rich tapestry of storytelling that continues to resonate with audiences today.

At its core, ""Citizen Kane"" explores the life of Charles Foster Kane, a media magnate whose rise to power and subsequent fall from grace serve as a poignant commentary on the American Dream. The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, driven by the investigation of a reporter seeking to unravel the mystery behind Kane's final word, ""Rosebud."" This structure allows the film to delve into the complexities of Kane's character, revealing the paradoxes of wealth, ambition, and loneliness.

Welles delivers a groundbreaking performance as Kane, embodying the character's multifaceted nature with remarkable depth. The supporting cast, including Ruth Warrick, Joseph Cotten, and Agnes Moorehead, adds layers to the narrative, each contributing to the intricate portrait of a man who ultimately remains enigmatic despite his public persona.

""Citizen Kane"" is a feast for the eyes, showcasing Welles's innovative use of deep focus cinematography, which allows multiple planes of action to be in sharp focus simultaneously. This technique serves to enhance the storytelling, drawing viewers into the world of Kane and intensifying the emotional weight of various scenes. The film's striking composition and meticulous attention to detail create a lasting impact that is still studied and admired by filmmakers today.

What makes ""Citizen Kane"" truly remarkable is its exploration of themes such as power, memory, and the ephemeral nature of happiness. The film's exploration of Kane's troubled relationships and the emptiness that accompanies his success is both timeless and relatable, prompting viewers to reflect on their own understanding of fulfillment and legacy.

""Citizen Kane"" remains a cinematic landmark that resonates with audiences across generations. Its innovative storytelling, unforgettable performances, and striking visual style solidify its place in film history. For anyone passionate about cinema or storytelling, ""Citizen Kane"" is an essential viewing experience that invites deeper contemplation and appreciation for the art of filmmaking.",9/10,17 July 2024,chiragrathod19,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
A Beautiful Portrait of a Tragic Character,"Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.

When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character. Another obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.

Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?

The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end ""Rosebud."" Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says ""A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known.""

It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud.

Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.

Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema.",9/10,8 October 2015,tjgoalie13,Citizen Kane (1941),POSITIVE
The master-piece,"You may ask yourself: what are criteria for a good movie? This is a question of great importance; it is still an unsolved problem. However, there are some titles which deserve to bear title ''good'' or even ''master-piece'' despite the fact that we don't have such criteria. They change you completely, so you don't need any further proofs that they are ''good''. Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane'' is certainly one of those titles.

Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist, was a very wealthy and powerful man. For decades, Kane had been influencing public opinion thanks to his media empire. But, ''as it must to all men, death came to Kane''. His death was an ordinary death. Old man died in his bed. His last word was an ordinary word - ''Rosebud''. Nevertheless, Kane wasn't an ordinary man. Wouldn't it be great if we could find out what he meant by ''Rosebud'' at his very end? Does ''Rosebud'' tell us something about Kane's life that can be helpful for understanding his personality?

In two hours of this master-piece, we didn't just get an answer to these questions. We got a story about Kane's whole life. Kane's childhood, youth, old age, moments of fear, love, suffering, his political failure, people he loved or, at least, possibly loved. After all that, at the very end of the movie, meaning of ''Rosebud'' is finally revealed. ''Rosebud'' is name for sleigh which represents Kane's childhood.

One could say: ''Well, what's exactly the point of all this? An old tycoon remembered his childhood, the period of his innocence; almost all men are emotionally connected to their childhood. Furthermore, there was no point in watching events on Kane's later life because they are completely irrelevant for the meaning of his last word.'' I strongly disagree to this kind of argument. In my opinion, Welles wanted to send a message to us. Two hours of Kane's life should show us that man (any man) is very complex being. Kane's acts, his speeches, his emotions are often strange and unexpected, even paradoxical. On the other side, his last word, ''Rosebud'', as I already said, represents his childhood. Childhood is period of simplicity. So, Welles' message could be: Even we are very complex, we naturally strive to simplicity. If that so, if we accept this as a truth, there will be a lot work for philosophers and scientists.

wow,"This film truly deserves all it acclaim this is by far the best film ever made and I couldn't agree more. Here is a list chronicling just some of the reasons this film is undoubtedly a cinematic phenomenon.

Kane- One of the most complex and intriguing protagonists in cinematic history. He is a egomaniac living in his own fantasy he created, he is distant and focused he was a child taken from innocence and normality and thrust into a corrupt world. He clings on to this innocence and what his life could have been to his death with the infamous ""Rosebud"". No one but Welles could have pulled this role off with his charisma, physical presence and the tone of mystery he engulfs Kane in, the scene where Kane looses it and destroys a room is haunting and Welles nails it subsequently creating one of cinemas greatest scenes in this spontaneous release of emotion from this typically distant and unemotional character.

The cinematography- Greg Toland who had previously done the cinematography for the vast and beautiful grapes of wrath. He teamed up with Welles and together they crafted some of the most beautiful and innovative cinematography ever to hit cinema. The direction will leave you astounded.

The script- No one expected much from the script since it was primarily written by a drunk out of work screenwriter (Herman J) and then edited and re wrote by a first time Theatre man (Orson Welles) to many's surprise the script utilised a new puzzle like narrative format loitered with character depth and subtle connections. The story is complex well developed and magnificent. The story also utilised the poetic device of ""rosebud"" a verbal representation of childhood loss and innocence. It not only deserved the Oscar it won for best script but it deserved many more.

Those are the 3 main points on why citizen Kane is a cinematic masterpiece. I did not touch on the other things that are great about it the universal focus, the score and the editing and excluding why its a technical revolution in the medium of film.

Fine Piece of Art !,"We are talking about a movie that can't be described fairly enough with words. A movie that gave the lead in cinema to Americans. Very well high effects that were very superior at the 40s. the scripts remains as one of the best ever (if not the best already) it is the only Oscar the movie won after all . When I first seen that masterpiece I didn't expect anything out of it .. because a dear friend warned me and told me not trouble myself seeing a such a crap film. Well, one day I told myself that I have to see it, at least to see what's wrong with it .. and I did see it twice after the 1st time .. and frankly every time I see the movie it proves without a doubt that ethier: it is the best American movie or the best movie of all-time. Orson Welles did a hell of a job directing, producing and acting .. even, the way he talks as old Charles Kane sounds so realistic, Orson Welles without a doubt captures even the soul of the character of Charles Kane. It is a shame not to give the movie its all eleven deserved Oscars .. but when we know that the multi-billionaire William H. fought so hard to prevent people of seeing this film which touches his life somehow, I say we will be glad that we had a chance to see such a movie, aren't we?

It is a movie that lost prizes but definitely won our interests of a fine piece of art.

Quite frankly the most intelligent film ever made,"Citizen Kane is a marvelous piece of cinema. It transcends all efforts made before and after it. What we have here truly is the great American film. The black and white cinematography is to die for. Kane is by far the most visually appealing film ever made. I find something new in it's shadows with each viewing and it takes a really great film to offer that to a viewer. American movie making really owes it all to Kane. It really is the only film I can think of that fails to break into a sense of monotony.

And of course Welles' performance must be praised. Here we have a twenty six year old man fresh off of a lucrative stage career make a seamless transition into film. To see Charles Foster Kane is to see the perfection of characterization. There are no loose ends with this character he is wrapped perfectly. Of course he is a metaphor for the joys and evils of capitalism. We must ask and why did he become what he did? The great thing about Kane is that it still proposes questions that require answers.how

In each viewing of Kane I just think to myself what bias cinema come to? There was a time when motion picture making was a challenge and it meant something. Kane should be studied because it is a perfect film. It gives the viewer something to think about and yet offers dynamic characters. And to think the lobotomized masses of American cinema goers would rather be watching a Transformers film. Now there's a series I would care to forget about. I mean what kind of movie has stupid robots? And that isn't even the problem with those poor excuses for celluloid. Each film in that series is a blood curdling experience. I absolutely hate the parent characters and Shia whatever his name is. The racial stereotypes are offensive and the idea of a Transformer heaven where Shia goes to in the first sequel is beyond ridiculous. I mean come on! And what about that stupid government organization? Really? You expect me to believe that they were able to keep a giant robot within the Hoover dam without nobody knowing about it? Or how about the fact that they actually had the transformer ship crash into the moon? You might infer that some telescope would catch wind of it. And the actor they got to play John Kennedy in the beginning of the film was doing the worst stereotypical Massachusetts accent ever. Transformers is dumbing down America pure and simple. All it exists to do is sell toys to idiot kids. Michael Bay makes millions of dollars while Orson Welles was abandoned by the Hollywood system. Really! It infuriates me.

fulfills every single expectation!,"i don't think that there is Any other film that raises so many expectations as 'Citizen Kane' does.

i watched it for the first and second time a couple of days ago and i really don't remember myself being full of so many expectations ever before watching any other film.of course there are new films coming out all the time where a favorite actor of yours is playing or a director directing etc' where you also have high expectations.

this case is different, here it is a film that is considered to be one of the best if not the best film ever made,leaving the fact of it being so old that just makes it much easier for a first viewer to be disappointed.anyways, i loved it!almost everything about it.the start, the ending, the story - that is alone so amazing and truthful, its just as if its a real man's life we are seeing a film about.the characters and obviously their acting as well, Jedediah, Kane, Bernstein, all of them really unforgettable.it took me by surprise, thinking before watching it that its a almost 70 year old picture I'm about to see, what could i possibly see in it that i haven't seen before?well, it doesn't get much more original then this.

the only reason i didn't rate it with an excellent 10 is that i kind of disliked Kane.in the start of the film you just adore his character but as you learn more and more about it you stop liking it.i surely understand the reasons for it, and how it is making the film realistic and Kane's story so similar to many other people's with their own minor lifts and major falls just like his.i didn't like many decisions Kane made and also in general i just couldn't relate to his character.

12 men in a room. Genius.,"In my opinion, 12 Angry Men is the greatest film that has ever been created. A perfect example of less is more, the simplicity of the plot, the setting of the one room, and the acting talent of the 12 main cast members is enough to conquer the dramatic genre, and ensure that it remains a timeless classic.

Whether you are a fan of the older generation of filmmaking or not, I implore you to experience this acting masterclass for yourself. More current movies such as Resevoir Dogs, which is superb in itself, have borrowed elements from 12 Angry Men, but trust me when I say there is nothing quite like this beautifully crafted drama. Watch it.

Excellent,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.

Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.

Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.

Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.

Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.

Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).

Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.

Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.

Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.

Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.

Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.

Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.

Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.

Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.

The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.

Juror #4 is why this is a great film,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.

"No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less","This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

How a film should be made. Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10",10/10,18 September 2002,Andrew Devonshire,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
"If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.","I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old ""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",10/10,22 September 2005,Thelightbulb,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
Simple but great.,"'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.

The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?

The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.

Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.

Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.

Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' mini-series. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.

Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!

"The over-used term ""classic movie"" really comes into its own here!","This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90's TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating's sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?

There could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer's attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY'S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant's guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very ""ordinariness"" is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they're all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!

12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how ""truth"" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?

This is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide. IF you haven't seen it - you really should do something about that!",No rating,12 August 2002,uds3,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
One of the great theatrical examples of what makes for superb drama.,"Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament.

Having been a very reluctant jury foreman, I find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. Everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. Martin Balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. Twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again.

This trial involves young John Sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. These men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (John Fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. Only one (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, ""There's always one."" There are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. At 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. It is Fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over.

While jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. Fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. He is quiet in his determination, making this typical Fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity.

Under the direction of novice Sidney Lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. Familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, to name a few. I could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. The one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is Lee J. Cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. He was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe (as was Fonda), but the Oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations.

Each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.

Gripping and Irresistable,"1957! 65 years ago and look at it, just look at it. This is Sidney Lumet's first feature film, up to this moment he had built his reputation on television. This was also the only film that Henry Fonda ever produced. He must have trusted Sidney Lumet very much and God was he right. Lumet concocts a masterful, choreographic coup. Within the four wall of the jury room the sense of claustrophobia, propels the drama forward in such a way that it's enough to catch a few minutes of the film to be totally hooked. Henry Fonda is superb and the rest of the cast a who's who of New York stage actors. From Jack Warden to Jack Klugman, from Lee J Cobb to E G Marshall. In my book, flawless.

Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....,"........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!

When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.

So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.

This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......

Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes,"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",7/10,20 October 2004,jmverville,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
12 Angry Men: Improper behavior of a juror,"12 Angry Men is the utmost in entertainment as a character study, but only that, not as jury reality. It is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. The viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. However, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint.

During jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. This is a classic case of improper jury behavior! Jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this ""second"" item. Reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. Additionally, the movie takes a considerable ""stretch of the imagination"" to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. The juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored.

Despite the excellent acting, 12 Angry Men is disturbing even if it is ""only a movie"" because the legal content is pure fiction. The movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. If the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. Also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. This juror (the late Henry Fonda) was not some kind of ""hero"" as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 Angry Men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. I have read that this is the only movie Mr. Fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.

What a Character-Study Is Meant to Be.,"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.

"Simple, yet brilliant","This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed.

Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox

"Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world","This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.

Classic in every sense and moment and frame,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",10/10,21 October 2019,kosmasp,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff,"This is one of the greatest films ever made...period. Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.

Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual ""who's who"" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show ""The Odd Couple""--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!

"Nobody knows the truth, and anything is possible.","However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.

One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.

I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",7/10,20 November 2021,TaylorYee94,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
Lays it on a little thick,"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.

The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.

Don't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson? Especially when Hollywood isn't any better than the rest of us.

No Dissonance,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

A Classic not to be Missed,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",8/10,17 March 2003,misha-wilkin,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
"""You can't send someone off to die with evidence like that"".","When I was a store manager for a regional supermarket chain, about thirty years or so ago, our team was presented a developmental seminar featuring ""12 Angry Men"". Breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. It was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. There was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. Watching today, I got stuck again right at the outset, figuring Jack Klugman's Juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by Henry Fonda's argument.

The film is an extraordinary piece of ensemble acting, and if the players weren't that well known back in the day, they have certainly made themselves a name since. Almost all have passed on, but to see actors like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Klugman all in one film is a veritable treat, even apart from the story. But it's the story itself that rivets one's attention to the screen, and the slow, methodical plodding Fonda brings to the table with convincing arguments even in the face of his own uncertainty about the case. With a surety that ""The facts are supposed to determine the case"", Fonda's character struggles to assure his fellow jurors that the life of an accused killer is worth the effort to consider reasonable doubt.

Aside from Fonda, the two most galvanizing characters are portrayed by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley. Begley, Juror #10, who exhibits the most extreme traits of racism and bigotry, forces each of the jurors to confront their own prejudices in an uncomfortable scene where almost every other juror stands up and turns their back on him. Cobb, Juror #3, has a much more personal investment in the trial, harboring a failed relationship with his own son that colors his view of the world. The really interesting point regarding Fonda's character is that he accomplished his mission without ever raising his voice. I don't think I could have done that considering the stakes involved.

It's a rare film that can anchor the viewer in one spot for an hour and a half and make time fly by with an intriguing story and realistic dialog. Rarer still is the ability to poke a finger at one's own pre-conceived notions of guilt or innocence, forcing the serious viewer to take a seat at the jury table and examine the facts from all sides before voting guilty or not guilty.

I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.

A Classic,"This movie is a very good example of what a good director can do with so little. Just the fact that everything happens in the same room is impressive. The details of the crime is only discussed, but it seems even more intterresting than if we would of actually seen it on screen. The characters are all played very well, the dialog is pretty good and the camera work is also really impressive for its time! Everything combined, this movie is simple but very good.

The CASE for 12 ANGRY MEN,"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!",10/10,25 February 2022,Tony-Kiss-Castillo,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
"""Everyone has a breaking point""","12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film.

Twelve Angry Men,"I thought that the movie Twelve Angry Men was great because of the way all the actors played their roles to perfection. This is a type of movie were no sound effects were use so it required the actors to really become the character they were portraying in the movie. Something else that I like was at first mostly everyone said that the accused was guilty of the crime but then slowly the jurors began to change their minds except for one juror. Some of the things that I didn't like was the way it was filmed in black and white because it cause me to have less attention towards it than I would have if I was watching a regular colored movie and also how the whole movie was just filmed in that one room and this did not allow us to see how the jurors lived their lives and acted around other people outside of a jury room. Between the movie or the play I would say I like the movie more because I am more of a visual person I learn things faster like that but other than that I thought the movie was interesting because of the way it allowed me to see and believe that character were who they really were when I was reading the play.

quickly goes astray,"For decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. This movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (& a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of American justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, Guilty and Not Guilty. A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared ""innocent."" The difference is important (occasionally Not Guilty and Innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). The jurors of '12 Angry Men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. The movie never clarifies this point. It would help these gentlemen immensely.

At both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. The jerks are too interested in hanging. The 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. At one point Fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is OK - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. ""What if the victim isn't dead?"" and ""What if there was no body?"" are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions.

It remains a good idea for a movie. There are strong points (a moment when E.G. Marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. Worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'What on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? Was this a 4-minute trial?' I'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who WOULD prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass.

In a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. To wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? Could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? That's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a McCarthy-era audience. I think I'd actually like this movie if Fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. His righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit.

This is only a good argument, not a good film. If you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (Do you like To Kill a Mockingbird?), this is for you. There's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. It's all important on the surface. There isn't movie I love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 Angry Men is a nobility machine. Viewers are fed through it, and come out the other end righteous.

An outstanding movie.,"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

I won't highlight a single performance, each is as remarkable as the next.

"So Simple, So Brilliant","So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",9/10,28 September 2006,ReelCheese,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE

People who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers.,"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me.

Good acting..but bad deliberating,"If this flick is an attempt to depict how jurors should not deliberate, then I might give it a 10. I'd wager this is not the case, though. The extant the jury went to go from almost unanimous guilty from the start to unanimous not guilty boggles the mind when one considers how weak the alternate theories were against very strong evidence of guilt. And the last thing debated, the eyewitness's eyesight, which seemed to be the thing that mostly turned the tide, should not have been debated at all since the lady's eyesight was never a subject at trial.

The burden of proof is on the prosecution and the defense need only find enough reasonable doubt equal in weight to the evidence of guilt for a not guilty verdict. But the doubt that the jury must find has to be reasonable. ""...but is it possible?"" is not enough, Fonda. It must be reasonable. The doubt found by the jury was no where near reasonable. Yet they found not guilty anyway. This is not justice.

The material is slightly forced for dramatic purposes but the delivery is perfect across the board,"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",No rating,27 April 2008,bob the moo,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
absolutely great movie and brilliant,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human.

I'm not angry with 12 Angry Men,"Sidney Lumet's first film is one of his best. Of course, it helps to have people like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley. It's great because you never know the names of the any of the jurors until the end. When you see this one, watch for the opening shot. It continues for I don't know how long. Its amazing how you are kept glued to the screen throughout, despite the fact that they never leave the juror room and they continue talking and talking. Yet, it fascinates you. At the beginning, you don't know a thing about the case. In the end you know every little detail. It may bore some, but I sure liked it.

Birds of a Feather...,"A room of jurors take their seats, deliberate; a young man's future on the line, his life at stake; twelve white middle aging men, show us time and time again, what diversity and difference helps negate.

A lesson about bias and prejudice, as relevant today as it ever was.

A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system,"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",9/10,19 February 2017,AlsExGal,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
A top-notch cast under superb direction by Sidney Lumet makes this movie excellent in every aspect,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role . Furthermore , a Russian version (2007) by Nikita Mikhalkov with Sergey Garmash , Valentin Gaft , Aleksey Petrenko , Yuriy Stoyanov , Efremov , among others .",8/10,4 January 2014,ma-cortes,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
Just watch the first 30 minutes of it and you'll put it far away on the very top of your list!!!,"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.

This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.

"THE classic jury drama, compelling but not without flaws","This is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.

The jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. The jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. The (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. He encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate Guilty verdict for a young Hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. As a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for Guilty to a unanimous final Not Guilty verdict.

No one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. Thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. The case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. Juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. These jurors are constantly bickering. One juror threatens to kill another. Eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot.

Surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should NOT be! While real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. For example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. I believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame.

As for juror number 8, at first I admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. However, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, I no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! This jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. A good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole.

While this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the American jury system. As such, I feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. If all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial.

I also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. What viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? This film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt.

Therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, I don't consider it flawless. At least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. Entertaining, yes, but I have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which I see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.

"From guilty to no guilty,,,,,,,this movie is true masterpiece.","Some movies are not for certain period of time but are eternal because of there perpetual topic. Murder is one of the oldest crimes in this world but murder of your own father is something astonishing. The movie is about a teenager accused of murdering his own father in an open case where all the indictments and witnesses are against him. The jury is called for verdict, and all of them are unanimously agreed on conviction. But one of the juror thinks to contemplate a bit on witnesses before giving a verdict as a life of teenager is on line, and from there the true brilliance of this movie begins as the way juror # 8 (Henry Fonda) unfolds all the witnesses are based on assumptions and anticipations . The way he demonstrates the happening of incident based on accusation is one of the true essence of this movie and in the end all jurors are convinced that ""No guilty"" is right verdict to be passed. The way story moves is marvelous ostentation of director Sidney Lumet's true brilliance. The movie is nicely written by Reginald Rose and is beautifully portrayed by all the actors especially Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobbs. This movie is truly a masterpiece and its impression will not be easy to diminish.

"Guilty or not guilty? Not guilty, except...","The film never says for sure whether the accused actually did it or not. But the whole plot of the film is for Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) to convince the other 11 jurors to give a verdict of not guilty, even though he himself is admittedly not 100% sure. Yes, there is a good chance the accused might actually be guilty.

Apparently, #8 has doubts but not necessarily reasonable doubt. He just wants to look for reasons why there might be reasonable doubt, even though there doesn't seem to be any reason for such at the start of the film. He just wants to talk about it and discuss things that should have been brought up by the defense.

#8 then gets a discussion going on why there might be reasonable doubt and go over the points of the case, points which you'd think would have been gone over by both sides of the case. One of the other jurors even says, ""Why didn't his lawyer bring that up?"" I forget what that point is but why indeed did he not, whatever it was? The juror is an architect, not a lawyer, so how can he be thinking of these things and not the accused's lawyer? Doesn't really make a lot of sense. ""Maybe he {the lawyer} didn't think of it"" is not a believable enough reason. The Fonda juror tries to raise reasonable doubt but that's the lawyer's job. Did the lawyer do that or not? If he did they should be going over tha, deliberating whether the defense created reasonable doubt, not looking for reasons of their own. If not, the Fonda juror really has no business holding court in the jurors' room or act the detective.

One of the points brought up by the Fonda juror is rather sketchy to me. He thinks the accused being slapped twice by his father is not enough of a motive to want to kill him. Except earlier he has brought up the point that the accused has been abused all his life, beaten with fists since he was five. These points are rather at odds with each other. Another juror even says, ""It may have been two slaps too many. Everyone has his breaking point."" Yet this salient point is kind of brushed aside, while the Fonda juror iterates his point about the victim being abused. For the record, if the kid was guilty, I'd say it was justifiable homicide, but that is beside the point. Why harp on about how the accused was physically abused as if it's a defense? I'd say it would logically work to the opposite effect, and argue for temporary insanity or a lesser murder charge.

Another point raised is the angle and height of the stab wound. One of the pro-guilty jurors demonstrates that it could be done only to be contradicted by another juror that the switchblade is not typically used in a downward motion but underhandedly. But if the fatal wound was high up on victim's chest how else could it have been inflicted but in a downward motion? Even a tall person would have to stab downwards if they wanted to stab their target high on the torso. If the switchblade were used as it typically is the wound would likely be lower in the body, possibly the abdomen, no matter the height of the assailant. Also, wouldn't the witness be questioned on the circumstances of the stabbing?

On that note, another point is raised about the witness needing to wear glasses. After some mental gymnastics about how the woman was trying to make herself look younger (and stereotypical remarks about women in general) it is determined that since the woman wore glasses it's possible she couldn't have made a positive ID. They don't know what kind of glasses they were, of course, they just determine that she would have needed to wear them to make a positive ID on the accused, even though the record shows she made a positive ID in her testimony. Are jurors allowed to disregard a witness's positive ID? I'm asking. Also, going back to the previous point, even if the witness's sight was not trustworthy, she might still have been able to determine the assailant's height and how he stabbed the victim.

Anyway, don't want to go on an on so I'll conclude. I originally gave this movie seven stars. I had the same reservations before as now, but also appreciated the performances by the solid cast. But the reservations seem to stand out even more now and I just can't bring myself to rate it any higher than a five, no matter how solid the cast or fine the performances.

"Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?","""If you follow the crowd, you will likely get no further than the crowd. If you walk alone, you're likely to end up in places no one has ever been before. This is not without its difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt."" – Oscar Wilde

Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" opens with a teenage boy sitting before a judge. He's been accused of murdering his father. All evidence points to him having committed the crime and even the kid's lawyer believes him to be guilty. Enter the jury: 12 men tasked with settling upon a verdict. It seems certain that they will all find the kid accountable. After all, the facts prove that this kid killed his father. Don't they?

The jury seclude themselves in a tiny room and take votes. 11 men find the kid guilty. One doesn't. The majority look at the 12th with bemusement. He's Henry Fonda, a mild mannered architect with a temperament of quiet confidence. How dare this guy disagree with them? How dare he stand alone?

Tensions develop and the men begin to argue. Fonda plays it cool, stating that he doesn't necessarily believe the kid to be innocent, he simply wants to discuss the matter. After all, a kid's life is on the line. Why make hasty judgements? Why not talk things out, investigate the issue and dig a little deeper? Reluctantly, the others agree to talk. The kid's guilty, no doubt about it, so why not grant this wacky guy a couple hours of discussion? They're getting the day off work anyway. Humour the guy.

And of course as the 12 men investigate the case, they begin to grow doubtful. Previously agreed upon truth comes crumbling down, ambiguities arise, new facts come to light, testimonies are cast in a new shade and the motives of witnesses and jurors are shown to be skewed by personal vendettas and a range of social/racial/personal biases.

The film eventually ends with Henry Fonda, an iconic actor in one of his finest (if far too angelic) roles, having convinced the entire jury that the kid is innocent. With his quiet probing, his appeals to curiosity, truth and intellect over emotional hysteria, popular opinion and snap judgements, Fonda successfully opposes the other jurors. The film's message: question the majority, test the Gods with a hammer and be suspicious of commonly held truths. And most importantly, be tactful when contesting the majority, least they threaten you with a switchblade. But who cares? Normal is only a statistical distribution anyway.

Upon release, ""Angry"" was read as a cautionary tale about McCarthyism, then a hot topic. Later its message became more broad: about a callous society's indifference to the less fortunate and willingness to unjustly sustain false accusations. Today, the film's almost a parody of bleeding heart liberals, many siding with the film's courtroom conservatives as a result. ""What is this?"" actor Lee J Cobb fumes in the film, ""Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week or something?"" His stance is typical today. The notion that offenders are too heavily viewed as victims of oppression, deprivation, racism, mental disorder, systemic problems etc, and so deserving of support rather than punishment.

Aesthetically, ""12 Angry Men"" is remarkable; Lumet's camera work is superb and the film drips with both atmosphere and tension. The film also differs hugely from other legal dramas, taking place almost entirely within a jury's room and so sidestepping most of the the usual genre clichés (courtroom antics, last minute testimonials, witnesses, cathartic group-hugs etc).

""12 Angry Men"" may also be the finest film shot around a table. Indeed, any director will tell you that filming large groups of people conversing over a table is one of the most taxing things to do. Keeping track of eye-lines, coverage, body positions, shooting each individual from multiple angles over and over again...it's a mighty chore just to get things down on the most basic level, let alone keep the thing feeling kinetic and fresh.

So what's remarkable about ""12 Angry Men"" is how much of a spatial movie it is. Director Sidney Lumet, who has a background in theatre (a very static medium, hence, perhaps, the initial appeal of such a claustrophobic script), charts his jury's room with a fluid camera. Watch how gorgeous his mise-en-scene is, how choreographed each character's body movements are, how Lumet's camera traces each character, assigning them spaces within the room. It's an incredibly organised little movie, Lumet dancing us deftly throughout this tiny arena, only to then spew his victors back out into the real world with a series of magnificently expansive shots.

Then there's the acting. Lumet has always been an actor's director, and here he populates his film with a wealth of wonderful character actors. But Fonda's the star of course. Dressed in an angelic white suit, he's exactly the kind of morally righteous everyman hero which made many of Jimmy Stewart's early roles so popular. With a mixture of ""aww shucks"", suave sexiness and quiet intelligence, Fonda's immediately endearing.

Unfortunately, the motivations of those who oppose Fonda are at times very heavy handed (everyone but Fonda is a raging buffoon, a sneaky attempt to elevate him), each one deliberately positioned to be shot down. End result: a heroic tale of progressive compassion defeating reactionary prejudice, in which the saintly conqueror of bigotry is himself bullying, has a firm agenda and is being buffeted by emotionalism.

10/10 – More great courtroom movies: ""The Verdict"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""Compulsion"", ""Death on the Staircase"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Capturing The Friedmans"", ""The Paper Chase"" and ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"". Lesser legal flicks: ""Inherit the Wind"", ""JFK"", ""Adam's Rib"", ""Anatomy of A Murder"", ""The Caine Mutiny"", ""Witness for the Prosecution"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", ""My Cousin Vinny"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"". Worth multiple viewings.

A Movie From 1957 That Speaks of It's Time,"Having seen the movie at least as many times as the number in it's title (or more), I will be giving an honest assessment and opinion.

First , these 12 actors performances are alive, vital and powerful, it's amazing how much tension and turmoil these actors made, in a movie set in one place. (Just like the stage play ). We briefly see the courtroom and later outside the building.

Made in the 1950s, we get the true tone and feeling of that time, because , for the most part, these attitudes were very real and dominant in that era.

If anyone expects a jury room to be exciting, normally it's not. If the actors played it like a normal jury, well, the film would only be a 30 minute TV special.

With Henry Fonda, first off, he gives a simplistic yet very deep performance in the way his character says ""not guilty"" but wisely does not say, ""I know he's not"". That would've undermined the whole of his performance.

Lee J. Cobb is fantastic. Not as prejudiced like the other older male juror but just angry inside at everything. Especially after Fonda calls him a ""sadist"" , when heaing how Cobb's character would like to dish out the boy's punishment himself.

John Fielder always great as the meek yet, somehow outspoken kind. That after he's finally pushed to say something and take a stand.

Jack Warden as a guy who'd rather be at the ballgame than having his life interrupted for something he could care less about. Which yes, is not a great mindset to have when asked to serve on a jury.

E. G. Marshall gives a quiet yet strong performance as well. A man who is so ""sure and certain"" about everything. Only to be proved wrong later. The rest are fantastic in their own ways as well.

I really love how Henry Fonda's character works with everything to show valid reasons for his vote. He has paid very close attention during the trial and has remembered many things that were said and noticed many things as well.

He bullies no one, into sharing his view ... but does state in demonstrating logic and reasoning (not in making anything up that is false or imagined). Everything he talks about, was presented, said or seen in the courtroom.

All the players here get a chance to speak their piece and I especially point to Jack Klugman, who coming from a similar neighborhood as the boy in question, does vote guilty at first, as like others, just wants to go home. He doesn't vote not guilty because of the boy's similar background.

In hearing slanders about 'those kind' from his kind of neighborhood, he let's his feelings be known and doesn't sugar coat it. Leading to a near confrontation.

Ed Bagley's very prejudiced juror, is finally confronted by the others, who are tired of hearing him yell his bigoted statements. He's basically and deservedly told to sit and say nothing more, giving him time to think and eventually, on his own, decide on not guilty.

Lee J. Cobb's character, his problem wasn't necessarily racial, as it was anger at his own son, who basically hates his father and wants no part of him.

Which is why he rips up the picture. (Which is to say to h*** with it) and is why he finally votes not guilty. He essentially is not going to send the young man to his death, based on his problems with his son.

I reviewed this movie for the strong dramatic acting, the simple but effective setting and it's overall production value and just the cleverness in how it all plays out. I know a well crafted movie when I see one and I base any review only on what is in the film and what it's about.

It was a play and has been done several movie versions and that's all 12 Angry Men is. A completely fictional story, not based on any real case. A movie that takes place in it's time and is of it's time. It's only a movie and I don't take it as anything other than this

Our court system and legal system of course, has changed greatly since the late 1950s, I couldn't say for sure if ""12 Angry Men"" may have had a small part in it....but I wouldn't be surprised.

10 stars from me.

It doesn't matter if I know whether the young man was actually guilty or not, or what in the 21st century would or would not be allowed.

What matters in any review, only, is the overall movie itself. Acting, setting , production value and nothing more. It is just n emotionally hard hitting drama. (END)

A real classic with great dialogues,"There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.

The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.

Intelligent writing at it's finest any lawmen should watch this,"Rating: 8.3

A dialogue-driven realistic character study that reminds you not to take things at face value. How each small revelation from the knife reveal to the subtle reveal that the woman could not have seen the killing because she wasn't wearing her glasses that night because one juror had imprints on his nose bridge that another juror noticed the woman had was masterfully done. It all made sense, and it exposes the viewer for not considering all possibilities as the movie progresses. There were nice metaphors such as the rain representing the temperament of the men and MC (juror 8) wasn't some white knight messiah complex MC whose altruism was obnoxious, he was just a man who wanted to consider all the possibilities before judging someone. We got to the not guilty not because the plot needed it to happen but because it made sense. Solid, intelligent, and probably should be a mandatory watch for all law students.

Best,"This is best movie for me. I love this movie. The film explores themes such as justice and the complexities of the system of judging a person. The film takes place in only one room and has no other locations than the trial at the beginning and it is really striking. Not all films manage to show the story in one room so well. Fantastic acting, top-notch script work and a good cast I think will impress everyone.

Thought provoking olden masterpiece,"I have been putting this movie off for later because of how old it is. But yesterday when I had nothing to watch I decided to watch it. And now I am glad that I watched it. This movie works in a very different way. At times you might get to know where the talks are going but there will also be times when you will be wrong too.

All instances in movie look super good. Especially for a movie that takes place in just one room it is too good. After watching a lot of modern movies a flick this olden masterpiece can make you feel real good about olden times.

Great actors and acting,"I agree with many of the reviews- less is more, great cast of actors. Love the premise of just following the jury in the room. Honestly after the first 30 minutes you could kind of tell where this story line was headed and it wasn't much of a surprise at the end. I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away. I will have to watch it again one day and see if I have a different opinion since everyone else seems enthralled with this movie. For me it was worth watching, but would not be anywhere near my top 20 best films ever.

How can one film be so good and so bad,"This is an excellent film. This is an awful film, It is both things at the same time. I watched this movie recently with the knowledge that its considered one of the all time greats but just found myself getting annoyed. While the acting was without doubt superb and the atmosphere was so well crafted you could almost smell the sweat coming off the 12 men and feel the heat and pressure of the approaching storm. I was Stunned with the stupidity of the plot, Anybody who has watch any courtroom drama will understand my point when I say everything that Henry Ford ask the other jury members to consider should have and would have been raised in the courtroom by even the most incompetent of legal teams, The old lady and her glasses, and the slow walking old man being the two most obvious but not the only point in question. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Therefore only a 5 out of 10 rating from me, but a fair rating I think you will agree.

Leave your prejudices outside the door,"One of the finest ensemble pieces of film ever made. 12 jurors debate, argue and sweat it out to decide the guilt or innocence of a teenager accused of murdering his father. This was Sidney Lumet's directorial debut. This film is almost entirely set in one room for 90 or so minutes, as the valiant dozen play cat and mouse with the accused's life. To 11 jurors it's an open and shut case - guilty. The defendant's life lays in the hands of one liberal juror (Henry Fonda). The film meticulously examines the facts of the case, as each juror provides reasons for their decisions. Fonda struggles to convince his fellow jurors that there is room for reasonable doubt, but he's working against dubious priorities and deeply-ingrained prejudices. Within the confines of a hot and angry room Fonda fights his corner, whilst highlighting both his open-minded and fair beliefs with the frailties and failures of his fellow defendants. Although unconvincing in detail, the film is absorbing, and made the more remarkable as it is almost entirely set in one room and yet holds the viewers attention. The acting is magnificent; the 12 actors are essentially the movie. A classic film, not using fancy plots or effects, but the talents of actors. A great piece of film making and one of the best films coming out of the US. Worth watching, if not just for analysing human weaknesses.

One of film history's finest,"You'll get films, then you'll get '12 Angry Men'. To put it as simply as possible, '12 Angry Men' is a cinematic phenomena. The alluring screenplay, astonishing direction, and memorable performances, especially Henry Fonda's character, are all something you must experience atleast once in a lifetime. Thank you Sidney Lumet for such a fantastic film. He gave us the likes of other cinematic phenomena such as 'Serpico' (1973), and 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975) which are also just as striking as '12 Angry Men', both essential viewings. Once again, please, please, please give yourself the chance to witness this coup de grace.

It's Just Great,"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

I do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time.",10/10,26 December 2016,vvejesus,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE

Gem,"This movie is a great drama centered around a young man on trial for the murder of his abusive father. While eleven consider the man guilty and destined for the electric chair, one hold out wants to look at the case with a closer eye. It is a great movie depicting the enormous responsibility that a juror has to let go of personal bias, pride and inattentiveness to help lady justice in her search for the truth. Great movie!!

Black and white movies usually throw me off, so I didn't have huge expectations for the movie. But boy, did it exceed them! This movie is an example to what you can accomplish when you have a killer script!

Cobb. His performance was very impressive. The story of the movie, despite its simplicity but it was wonderful, made me wonder if the person is able to do justice or if he could not understand it, I would advise any cinema lover to watch the movie and my rating 9.6

I love chamber dramas - but this was a tedious exercise,"I ma writing this as a fan on chamber dramas such as Hitchcock's wonderful Rope and as someone who really wanted to like this movie:

I found the movie to be very repetitive.

The first time a piece of evidence is dismissed, I was still interested in watching the discussion. But when evidence two, three and so on were discussed, I felt like ""okay, I got the message.""

There was no change in the dynamic of the people, no surprises, just the same conversation again and again.

I also couldn't empathize with the characters. They all felt very one-dimensional and kept their assigned roles throughout the film without any development.

I the end, I just wanted to movie to be over.

Character study in a small jury room.,"This movie, currently ranked as #21 all time on the IMDb list, is a simple story of the deliberations of 12 men on a jury of a murder trial. We see nothing of the actual trial or the closing arguments. The story begins as the judge instructs the jury, in weighing the evidence presented, they must return a verdict of 'guilty' unless there is reasonable doubt. Although not made clear in the movie, a verdict of ""not guilty"" is not the same as 'innocent.' Not guilty simply means that the prosecution did not present a case strong enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The case that we do not see or hear of first hand involves a son accused of murdering his father. One witness was an elderly man who claimed to have seen the boy running down the stairs from the apartment a few seconds after hearing voices and a body hitting the floor. Was this old man who shuffled along really able to get there in time? Could he really hear clearly over the noise of the passing train? Another was a woman who identified the boy as the one plunging the knife into the victim. But did she wear glasses, and did she have them on when she claimed she saw the murder 60 feet away through the windows of a passing train on elevated tracks (the 'el')?

First seated the jurors take a vote, and it is 11 to one in favor of conviction. There is a ball game that evening and many of the men are anxious to delivered a verdict and get home. One man (Henry Fonda) says he is not sure, the boy may in fact be guilty, but suppose he isn't. He just wants to talk about it. A boy's life is at stake. Don't they owe it to him to examine all possibilities? But the other 11 at first look upon their task as one to convince the lone juror that he is wrong.

As the 90 minutes move along, various jurors bring up points that they noticed, possibilities that neither the prosecution nor the defense attorneys had brought up. Others gradually join the 'not guilty' side, until it is only one for 'guilty.' Then there were none. Much of the dialog brought out prejudices certain men held, that were clouding their reasoning, and preventing them from seeing both sides of the argument. This is a story less about jury verdicts, and more about human nature.

The movie sets out to show that with reasonable doubt at hand, a verdict of 'not guilty' must be returned. Thus it is mostly an examination of how our personal prejudice can cloud our judgment. I suspect that this story was much more significant 50 years ago than it is today. There have been a number of very public trials (e.g. OJ Simpson) where most of the evidence appeared to point to guilt, but a jury returned a 'not guilty' verdict because of reasonable doubt. However it remains part of the foundation of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proved guilty, even if it means some guilty persons will go free.

Although only Lee J. Cobb stands out, as the angry juror who was the last hold out, this contained a fine ensemble cast. Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Ed Begley are others who are prominent in my mind.

The very precise example of reasonable doubt,"In this movie, it is flawlessly shown that when big deals are involved, no matter how uncanny the evidence may appear at first, there should be some time allocated to think about others' conclusion and look at it from an angle that questions its truth value.

But a man mustn't deny the truthfulness of a matter just for the sake of unity with others, or to put it better, to fit in. This is clearly seen at approximately 1:46 in the movie when juror 11 talks to juror 3 that I will type the exact conversation for better influence down below:

Juror 11: He's right, that's not an answer. What kind of a man are you? You have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket. And now you've changed your vote because you say you are sick of all the talking here?

Juror 3: Ah listen, buddy...

Juror 11: Who tells you that you have the right to play like this with a man's life? Don't you care...

Juror 3: Now wait a minute. You can't talk like that to me!

Juror 11: I can talk like that to you. If you want to vote ""not guilty"" then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty not because you've had enough. And if you think he is guilty then vote that way. Don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?

Another lesson from this movie is always to put yourself in the shoes of someone you are trying to judge. Which I believe is shown at roughly 1:12 in the movie when juror 8 talks to juror 4 about his weekly schedule and asks about a few nights back when he had seen a movie and that he can't remember the plot or even the name of that movie. And the sound of something breaking inside juror 4 is heard when a bead of cold sweat runs down his forehead.

Another thing that was worthy of attention in this film was the fan that didn't work. While most of the men in the jury room were hot and complaining about the warmth of the room and one of them saying this is gonna be the hottest day of the year (and not likely to change). And when it gets dark and they have to turn on the lights, they discover that now the fan actually works. I think these two change of situations are two main ways to look at the whole shape of the movie. The change in the weather (which no one, not even the weather bureau, could predict) symbolizes the whole change in the overall vote of the jurors. And the whole ""fan situation"" is trying to tell that some light shed on a problem, can change everything.

The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good.,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8/10,2 June 2022,kevin_robbins,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",9/10,15 May 2016,Sebastian_Conrad,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
Absolutely great,"This is one of those movies that i had to replay a second time the moment i saw it. Something about the way in which the plot flows to suggest to its viewer to watch closely, for the devil is in the apathy. Or is it?

Anyway, if you don't like long conversations spare yourself the time, but if you do, you're in for a fascinating character study. After all, this is one of cinema's gems that has stood the test of time.

Sixty years later and still better movie hasn't been made,"I wanted to take a while before writing anything about 12 Angry Men. Before I saw this movie I had been thinking about how can a black & white movie, made in the 50's and shot almost entirely in one room, be fifth on IMDb? Now, after seeing it, I'm thinking about why is it not rated even higher. In this review I'm going to try to explain what makes this movie so brilliant.

First, have you noticed how this movie feels so natural? Not even once was I feeling bored or exhausted. Everything runs so smoothly, constantly making you more interested in what had really happened. One of the factors which makes this so is interrupting serious debate with brief and sometimes longer scenes which don't contribute to understanding the topic. Nothing is omitted. This dynamic (which Hollywood nowadays doesn't utilize) serves as a mean to present that humans don't operate as computers. We are intrinsically flawed and able to enjoy, be serious or disdain certain situation. Recall, for example, scene in the bathroom, talking about sports, playing with fan, etc. This gives viewer some space and time to think about what had been said. You can make your own judgment and defragment all information. Viewer thus becomes a sort of a ""13-th juror"" actively participating in a conversation.

Second, this movie raises serious questions about how can we know anything about historical events. How do you evaluate and interpret given evidence? There are two schools about the topic: first claims that one can never objectively construct sequence of events because of our subjective nature; second claims that we can objectively assert what really did happen. This two approaches make much sense in 12 Angry Men. Some jurors are unable to objectively asses the evidence because they are very restrained by their own feelings or prejudices. The way they interpret the material is thus very biased (Juror #8: ""It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."") The point is that every one of jurors (including the viewer) is biased but they take different approaches to the problem. This leads us to third point.

Everything said above lead us naturally to the problem of jurisdictional decision making. The most important thing here is the term of reasonable doubt. Some of the jurors don't actually understand what does that mean so they can't handle the problem well. It somewhat scary thinking about how can twelve men from different backgrounds, of which some don't event understand or care about the case, make a decision about someones' life. If the juror is not convinced beyond reasonable doubt (not any doubt!), than he's obliged not to accuse defendant guilty. Reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof one has to surmount if he's to accuse someone guilty. That's an important difference between exact sciences and law approach as one of the jurors notices (Juror #12: ""Oh, come on. Nobody can know a thing like that. This isn't an exact science."") So we see jurors one by one changing their belief when their certainty drops below reasonable doubt. This takes us to the next point.

Let's take a closer look on the particular order each of the jurors voted not guilty. First you have a guy who just wanted to take a closer look at the evidence. He lit a spark. Then you have an old man wanting to hear why others think the accused is guilty. One by one the change their minds. The last ones where a guy who had prejudices about ""street children"" and the juror who was shouting all the time. This was done intentionally. People who had personal problems with something or someone are always hardest to engage in objective discussion about the issue. Forgiveness is a cure, not turning back on it. Nobody convinced the last juror to change his mind; he convinced himself after seeing a picture of his son. It's like his heart (not mind as with others) couldn't take it anymore. Juror before him had general prejudices. Those people can have a hard heart but are more easy to engage than those with personal problems. He realized his mistake after everyone had started to ignore him. Those with personal problems must confront them by themselves; those with prejudices must confront with others. So the conclusion is that it's harder to confront with someone whose problems lie in their heart than with those whose problems lie in their mind.

Closing remarks: Table has always been an important component in our western culture. It's a place where all important decisions are made and where people get to eat and drink and know each other. That's why one the last shots is camera smoothly running over the table jurors where sitting at. Someone was there and something happened. It's a contrast to the last scene where we see Fonda leaving the building and disappearing into the crowd. Twelve men, who had never seen each other previously and don't even know each others names, with completely different backgrounds and profiles, accidentally sat together and did something important. Now they continue on, probably never seeing each other again. But table stands as a witness.

There are many other elements left to be analyzed. It's better to speak about them sitting at the table discussing with other people than reading a review. I hope this general description of the movie mechanic helps someone understand what lies underneath the hood or makes her or him approach this movie with more scrutiny.

Interesting and relevant movie!,"It is interesting that this movie takes place almost entirely in a single setting, which is the courtroom. Through this movie, it can be seen that each jury members have different perspectives and interests which resulted in the different votes. In reality, some discussion or negotiation has to be done to reach a favorable decision because in a situation with multiple stakeholders, different stakeholders will have different personal interests they wish to hold onto or achieve. Hence, i felt that this movie was very relevant to the situations we may face in reality. If no negotiation is done, those who make biased decisions may possibly jeopardize the entire situation or cause losses to others, which in this case, was the life of a teenage boy.

The way the movie evolves from 11-1 in favor of guilty to 11-1 in favor of acquittal was very interesting as the points brought up by jury 8 was unexpected because it was so detailed and specific. This movie changed my perception of black and white movies, and i really enjoyed this movie.

Let's take off the nostalgia glasses,"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.

"One of the best, most essential movies you could ever watch","At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.

This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.

The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.

Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.

It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",10/10,6 May 2022,I_Ailurophile,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE

Character building and diversity 101,"No surprise really that it belongs to the T5 imdb rated films, its rare for most to watch black and white movies nowadays especially a 1957 production but what this movie produces in terms of character perception and individual character writing is brilliant, like something I've never seen. The longing dialogues and smart character placement and even motivations display each and every character in a different lights this could even be conveyed into todays everyday life where we all have different wants and act different under pressured.

Honestly soso well written with brilliant acting.

One of the most complete and complex works I've seen,"12 angry men was surprisingly elaborate and complete. Even though it's from the 50s it was fast paced enough that you keep interest the whole 90 minutes - and it's just people arguing in a room about death penalty and the weight of a man's life.

Unsurpassed Character Study & Very Good Drama,"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",No rating,27 September 2004,Snow Leopard,12 Angry Men (1957),POSITIVE
"Simple film, gets you thinking.","The only way I feel I could write a review on this film is to take some of my background knowledge of the film ie. The awards it won and the play by the same name.

This film is based on one set, a courtroom side room where a Jury of 12 men are stuck in a room with only one person voting not guilty and it builds from there.

The casting is good, I personally recognised only 4 other of the cast from A-movies, which is good as only their 4 stereo-casted characters came out in the film most notably Henry Fonda 'reasonable stubborn wise man' character.

The storyline was good in the sense that it kept you hanging till the end and weigh up the question 'reasonable doubt'.

My only downside to this film was the ending. Ie there wasn't one. It felt like they run out of money and stopped.

Some birds aren't meant to be caged.,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.

An incredible movie. One that lives with you.,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.

Don't Rent Shawshank.,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.

Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.

But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10/10,21 November 2005,EyeDunno,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.

After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.

Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.

It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.

With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.

OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.""

This is How Movies Should Be Made,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10/10,18 February 2008,alexkolokotronis,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
Prepare to be moved,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.

Shawshank Redeems Hollywood,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.

With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",10/10,27 August 2002,weswalker,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

Eternal Hope,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10/10,15 June 2018,nowego,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.

Stephen King's best adapted movie,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10/10,13 July 1999,baumer,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.

Mystery,"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.

Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction,"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.

"Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!","Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.

Two movies in one,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?

"Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!",10/10,6 February 1999,schnad,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

All-time prison film classic,"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story – the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the ""best film of all time"" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.

Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.

The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.,"My life is forever changed due to this movie. It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship. It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.

As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.

This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. For some of those people time will tell. As for now I'll be patient to wait and see. Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out. There is someone out there that cares for you. Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.

Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.

If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10

"""I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning"".","Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.

Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's ""Cool Hand Luke"", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.

But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.

I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.

"Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .","I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.

I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).

If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.

I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.

I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",7/10,12 April 1999,DrJoTab,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
Very unoriginal,"I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.

This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best.

The best story ever told on film,"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....

I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.

But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.

Thoroughly recommended.

"""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook""","None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.

In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.

He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.

There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.

Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.

Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.

The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.

The Greatest Movie of all Time,"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.

When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.

The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.

I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.

The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.

Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.",10/10,16 July 2013,josephledbury,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?

Masterpiece,"Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)

**** (out of 4)

An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and once there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters and walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others couldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very low and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the reputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1 at IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a prison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about friendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts in many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is as large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont takes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years. Another wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the twenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel cheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful screenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the supporting characters are very well written. What really brings this magic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and I'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right in this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make for one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way Robbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as Freeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a care in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but what's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us the story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times breathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than most movies.

A movie revolution upon all others,"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.

This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!

Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!",10/10,30 December 2007,blairgallop7,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
never give up hope,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!

life changing,"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life

Over Rated,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.

Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.

On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.

This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.

"Not worth the hype, a script full of shortcuts","Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.

To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't get how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike.

The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy.

The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.

This movie just doesn't work.

Greatest movie of all time!,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.

I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!

Redemption,"This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.

The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.

Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.

To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.

To describe this movie as ""great"" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.

Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words......

A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.,"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.

Busy dying or busy living?,"**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**

This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it. I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved. Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.

So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film. It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.

Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.

Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.

In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.

It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.

The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing. Some of it is rocky and uncertain. Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'. This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store. In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.

This is crucial. For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen. And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding. The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.

The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying. To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.

So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.

Shawshank Redemption- Prison Film is Redeemed by Quality ****,"An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.

As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.

This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.

Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences.

This is a wonderful movie!!!!,"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking.

An incredible movie. One that lives with you.,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.

Don't Rent Shawshank.,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.

Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.

But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10/10,21 November 2005,EyeDunno,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

This is How Movies Should Be Made,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10/10,18 February 2008,alexkolokotronis,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
Prepare to be moved,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.

Shawshank Redeems Hollywood,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.

With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",10/10,27 August 2002,weswalker,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

Eternal Hope,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10/10,15 June 2018,nowego,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.

Stephen King's best adapted movie,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10/10,13 July 1999,baumer,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.

Mystery,"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.

Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction,"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.

"Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!",10/10,6 February 1999,schnad,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
Simply the best,"There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart. It's one of the best films ever made.

"Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .","I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.

I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).

If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.

I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.

I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",7/10,12 April 1999,DrJoTab,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE

The Greatest Movie of all Time,"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.

When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.

The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.

I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.

The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.

Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.",10/10,16 July 2013,josephledbury,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
From my favorite movies..,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.

Undeservedly top 1,"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors. I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?

"Overlong, Overblown and Over-rated","Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!

No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)

It worries me that many of the comments here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.

I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

A movie revolution upon all others,"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.

This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!

Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!",10/10,30 December 2007,blairgallop7,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),POSITIVE
never give up hope,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!

life changing,"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls.

Over Rated,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.

Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.

On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.

This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.

Greatest movie of all time!,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.

I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!

A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.,"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards.

The Wizard of Oz,"Fantastic tale about a Kansas farm girl who's spirited off to the wondrous land of Oz. The film still tingles with freshness and beauty. Garland is forever memorable as Dorothy Gale, the young girl and the supporting performances of Bolger, Lahr,Haley, Hamilton and Morgan are all stand out and will remain national treasures. The superb songs of E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen are still beautifully blended with the lovely photography, cinematography and art direction. Unforgettable!!!

We're off to see the Wizard! The Wonderful Wizard of OZ! This movie is so magical!,"Directed by Victor Fleming, the 1939 musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is probably the most well-known and commercial adaptation based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. While the film is so dated, it's still watchable even today becoming part of American pop culture. The film is known for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters. The movie starts out amazing black and white, with Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), a young farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle, in Kansas in the early 1900s. She decide to run away, due to Dorothy's dog Toto, biting a neighbor. Before she can get far, a tornado comes up, carried her and her house to the Technicolor world of Oz. Dorothy find out that the only way to get home is to find the Wizard (Frank Morgan). With help from Gilda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and some new friends on the way, like Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin-Man (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lehr), they make their way to the Wizard on the dangerous yellow brick road, where the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is looking for revenge for Dorothy accidentally killing her sister. All the actors were wonderful in their roles, playing multiply complex parts, bringing the comedy and music and dance alive. Still, it was bit over the top. All the actors also play the farmhands in the beginning, making you wonder if all this Oz was just a dream. That was the main different between the film and the book. There were other things that the film change, such in the case of Dorothy's age. Shirley Temple was originally wanted for the role, but since they couldn't get her. They got Judy Garland and had to change the age from 7 to 16. They even wanted the blonde curls that Temple is famous for. The wig was top heavy and kept getting mess up, so they took it out, and went with Garland's natural hair. It's creepy in a way, that Dorothy was literally based on Frank Baum's daughter that die in childbirth. Frank Baum was known for his medium spiritual belief, and you see it in the character of Professor Marvel (also Frank Morgan). It's believe that the Wizard character represent fault power leader. The Wizard can be allegory to what Baum thought was fault power leader at the time, such as President McKinley who introduce the Gold Standard, in which many historians believe was represented by the Yellow Brick Road. Oz is indeed: an abbreviation that stands for gold, a hot political topic of the day where people were rallying for fixed gold and silver ratios. Some believe that, the Wizard in the film represent Franklin D. Roosevelt who was known to make illusions to sound strong and look powerful, when trying to present the New Deal to Americans at the time. Emerald City is allegory to Washington D.C that looks like money, but in the end, the film, it was dull white. If the novel, Emerald City look was based off the White City in the 1893's Chicago World Fair. Then 1939's Emerald City was the New Deal, Washington D.C. Then, all of Dorothy's friends could be presented as Coxey's Army, an group of unemployed workers made out of farmers (Scarecrow), laborers (Tin-Man) and free silver supporters (Cowardly Lion). It is said that the Lion represents 19th century politician William Jennings Bryan, who was viewed as someone having a load roar, but no power or bite. Honestly, in the book, the Bimetallism Ruby slipper were really silver. There were a lot of things that wasn't in the film that was in the novel such as the visit to China Country, Queen of the Field Mice, the battle with Giants Spiders & Kalidahs, and the attack of the armless Qualdings. Talking about missing limbs. Civil War vets with prosthetic limbs were inspiration for the Tin-Man. There is a tale that Tin Man was indeed a munchkin named Nick Chopper. The screenwriters wanted Tin Woodman to be a hardened criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. The torture of being encased in the suit had softened him and made him gentle and kind. Wow, that's really dark. Another dark urban legend claimed that, in the film, a Munchkin could be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree and swinging back and forth in the left background, but it was just a bird. There were a lot of weird rewrites, like a spoiled, selfish princess in Oz outlawing music and others. The role of the Wicked Witch of the West was also enlarged for the movie. While, the Witch of the West in the novel was less evil. I think this role fit the film, well. Mad props to Hamilton for continuing the role after getting badly burn during production. There are at least 44 major differences between the book and this movie. Nevertheless, the film was far more faithful to Baum's original book. Still, they almost cut the most famous song from the movie, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' written by E.Y 'Yip"" Harburg. Glad, they kept it. The song ""The Jitterbug,"" was instead delete. The film footage for the song been lost, but you can find the 'Jitterbug' footage rehearsals on newer DVDs version. I still dig the other songs. ""Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead"" ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" and ""The Merry Old Land of Oz"" are some of my favorites. The movie always have great special effects, and top production value for the time. Still the story is lacking an overall moral and there were lot of not necessary extra scenes that could be cut out. Overall: a great movie that will forever be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I have to agree.

Classic,"Greetings from Lithuania.

Surely it is impossible to review a movie like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) when first time seeing it in 2022 - 83 years after it was released. I don't think this movie aged that well, but probably this is my cynical heart is speaking. On the other hand i could easily vote this movie a 10/10 because i believe that people who saw i back at its initial release were blown away by the experience. Yet like i said as seen today for a first time one can only admire it.

Overall, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is surely is a Hollywood product of its time. One can not properly view it now in 2022, given that cinema since then has changed many times. There is only a charm of innocence left to it that is long gone from cinema now.

Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?,"This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.

Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe ""Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box"", I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even ""Star Wars"" has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.

Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking ""Isn't she dead yet?"" There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - ""Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard"" is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.

Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.",10/10,4 May 2013,AlsExGal,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Still Has Its Magic,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this fine production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.

There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?

The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.

The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",No rating,27 September 2004,Snow Leopard,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
A true cinematic milestone,"Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.

The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number ""Over the Rainbow"" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.

The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.",10/10,7 May 2006,robb_772,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.,"Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.

The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.

The Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.

The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.

There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!

One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",10/10,26 December 2008,hitchcockthelegend,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Finding Her Way Back Home -- To Our Hearts.,"Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.

What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.

And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it's that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to ""seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.

Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can't imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.

And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it's more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.

THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.

You should never believe that this movie is from the 30',"First of all i want to say sorry for my English!

For a few days ago I watch Victor Flemmings ""Gone With the Wind"". I was so impressed over the film so i went to watch ""The Wizard From Oz"". And what a movie. You should never believe that this film is from the late 30's. The effects and music fit in the film. It deserve the 2 Academy Awards it has won for Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Original Score.

I found the film pretty funny with all the different character. This is one of the best films from the 30's. You can say many things about ""The Wizard from Oz"" but this film will never die.

Fantasy Classic,"The Wizard of Oz is a long time favorite of mine. One I used to watch every Easter with my family. It is a delightful classic film.

This film I believe most all movie watchers have seen and have drawn their own conclusions as to whether or not they like the film.

I know of hard-core blood and gore fans that enjoys The Wizard of Oz due to it's darker tones (witches, wizards and evil flying monkeys). And there are others that I know of that prefer a more ""wholesome"" style to their films which include this movie. Really this film brings together people who are basically different from each other - from hard-cores all the way to wholesome - not many movies have this capability.

A cinematic achievement that never truly grows old.,"""You have no power here! Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!""

It seems a little silly to be writing a review of The Wizard of Oz. It's the movie that's been seen by more people than any other in history. Most of us have seen it 10 times by the time we're seven. But I'll put my two cents in anyway, from an adult's point of view.

As a kid, I thought the munchkins were slightly creepy and the winged monkeys much more so, but I loved Dorothy and I loved the songs, and the entire movie was just so bright and colorful that I find it hard to believe that any kid could dislike it. Now, at the age of 25, I can still recognize the merit of it, without being influenced much by a lasting nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz is a lot like Alice in Wonderland (my all-time favorite children's novel), it treats children like they're smart and clever and capable of understanding and handling ideas that sometimes we adults forget they can get a handle on. The danger and excitement of The Wizard of Oz is a true adventure, be it a candy-coated one.

I can also better appreciate now the staggering amount of work and creativity that went into bringing this novel to life. It's just remarkable, really. The choreography, the classic songs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects, they're all still impressive today. More so, really, because many of the tools used to make modern movie magic weren't available back then. And Judy Garland...really, what needs to be said about her that isn't blindingly and extraordinarily obvious? No one else could have been Dorothy Gale.

It was nice to revisit this once again, and while some of my childhood adoration for The Wizard of Oz may be gone, my admiration for it still remains.",7/10,10 November 2010,lewiskendell,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
This is a metaphor of America,"It's often been said that this is a simple tale, a story of the coming of age for Dorothy. It's not that simple. It's also a story of the coming of age of America as seen through Dorothy's eyes.

Dorothy is a familiar American teen who grew up on a farm, a bit naive, never been to a city, but heard about them. Is family focused, but starting to open her eyes to a bigger world around her and looking for familiar structures through which she can understand that world.

The scarecrow, who thinks he's lacking a brain, is the American farmer. Usually minimally educated, often thought (at that time) of as stupid or ignorant, but it's proved through the movie that farmers in fact have a brain. Farmers are often known for their strong common sense and wisdom which is often undervalued by city folk or college types.

The cowardly lion represents the elected politicians. Afraid to do anything - especially preemptive - and shirks facing any controversy until it bites him on the rear. Only later to find that the problem was impotent all along. Politicians haven't changed in some ways.

The tin man represents industry, which is often seen as heartless machine. But when run by people who have compassion, companies have proved to ""have a heart"". This generosity is often seen in the form of philanthropy, but sometimes exists right in the corporate culture itself. Industry isn't always as heartless as a robot (or computer, to use a more modern metaphor).

Poppies, which represented the opium drug from China that can distract us from our goals and our responsibilities, like the more modern cocaine, marijuana, or even liquor, etc.

The ""wizard"" turns out to be only a mere human, as all of our heroes turn out to be in the end. We can strive to be like them, but it's only when others place us on a pedestal that our daily acts of heroism seem larger than life. It's those daily acts when added together that are truly the heroic in us all.

The wicked witch, the ""enemy"" of America, requires more than just an army to be overcome, it also requires brains, courage and a heart to be overcome. By ""heart"" understand that compassion, sympathy and empathy are vital weapons in the battle, which is why America invests so much in foreign aid.

It's this depth of storytelling that keeps us captivated by this movie as adults. There are many other reviews that better articulate the other great features to this film, such as the visual appeal, the music, the singing, the dancing, and...

Too bad no one sees the whole version anymore,"If you watch the TV version, you are truly missing out on one of the most important connections to be made. We all know why the farm hands played the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, but do you know why DOrothy sees MIss Gulch as the Wicked Witch of the West? In the version broadcast in the 50's the movie opened with Dorothy walking home from school as the current version hints at. What viewers don't see today is that Toto wondered off into Miss Gulch's garden and was chased out by MIss Gulch with a broom. She threatens to take the dog or at least report Dorothy and Toto to the Sheriff, which she eventually does. DOrothy runs from Miss Gulch toward the farm and when she reaches the entrance road to the farm, the new broadcast version picks up the story. I understand or was led to believe that this portion of the film was edited for TV broadcast and lost in a fire forever. I consider it to be one of the most important parts of the movie.

"A Wiz of a film, if ever a Wiz there was","The NBC Peacock began unfolding its wings. ""The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black & white--on NBC."" That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma's in 1968. When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.

This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network. In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television. It was ""Oz."" Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does. What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, ""Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!""

Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps ""The Sound of Music."" Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, ""The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!"" Yikes! In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.

I can't say that ""Oz"" doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies. It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings. The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible. And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action. Certain numbers like ""Merry Old Land of Oz,"" I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.

Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves. I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, ""Step forward, Tin Man!"" What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result? ""Oz"" is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.

The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light. This was done due to the lack of a suitable ""color film"" in 1939. That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives. Because ""Oz"" was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded. So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality. Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr. But they all hold up amazingly well.

""Oz"" has a valuable message. As the pop group America once said, ""No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have."" If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack. The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.

I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.

Flawless,"The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with ""the best."" It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.",10/10,29 November 2014,utgard14,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Great film for ... everybody:))),"When I was a very little boy, I saw that movie on The Bulgarian National Television and I really fell in love with it:)). It was a kind of magic that took my heart to eternity and from there it saw all the world in a very amusing way:)). I will probably never forget the first time I saw that movie...I really hope that everybody will continue watching it and it won't be among the forgotten movies... If you're very very young and you haven't seen it yet, then see it, you will feel the greatest force of the white magic:)))).

Judy Garland is THE PERFECT DOROTHY!!!:)))

See it, OK??:)))))

My childhood favourite!,"I am 16, and I still love this movie. I grew up watching this, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Meet Me in Saint Louis, and I never tire of them. Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10. Bethany Cox

An enchanting film with flaws that cannot seriously mar its durable delights,"Dorothy's trip, as we follow her from her Kansas farm down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City and back home again, is depicted with rare cinematic imagination and skill

At the beginning, we may wonder at the obvious falseness of the black-and-white Kansas setting, although the monotonous, arid landscape ultimately makes an effective contrast to the later scenes in Oz But rationality disappears the moment Judy Garland strikes at the heart with her trembling singing of ""Over the Rainbow."" And when Frank Morgan appears as Professor Marvel, we are captivated by his familiar bumbling charm

Dorothy's entrance into the land of Oz remains one of the screen's most memorable moments, as the black-and-white scene give way to glowing color photography ""I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!"" is her understated response as she enters Munchkinland The sequence in Munchkinland, though beautifully designed, is actually, a mixed blessing Billie Burke is exactly right as the Good Witch of the North, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderfully shrill and repulsive as the Wicked Witch of the West But the Munchkins themselves, midgets gathered from all over the world for the occasion, are all wonderful with their prematurely old faces and chipmunk voices

The talents of Dorothy's friendsJack Haley as the Tin Man, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lionhave been frequently celebrated, but their good humor and their shining humanity behind the grotesque makeup remain fresh eternally

""The Wizard of Oz"" is a joy forever Why does it still glow, while other films of the period grow dimmer every year? It is unquestionably due to more than the sum of its sterling cast, winning songs, and lovely special effects, although the absence of these virtues has turned more than one ""musical fantasy"" into failures It may be that Dorothy steps from black-and-white Kansas into the bright colors of Munchkinland, she is taking everyone's first voyage of discovery With the universality of the best fables, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has her learning about evil (the Wicked Witch), friendship (her companions on the road to Oz), and fallibility (the Wizard). And somehow childrenand the child in all of uslike to see this voyage made repeatedly

Children as adults, today as in 1939, ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain for us the beloved movie ever made!

Not Really a Friend of Dorothy,"During the British general election of 1983, the centrist Social Democratic Party mocked their political rivals by depicting Margaret Thatcher as the Tin Man and Labour leader Michael Foot as the Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"". The accompanying caption read ""One hasn't got a heart; the other hasn't got a brain"". Unfortunately, they appear to have forgotten that Dorothy had three companions, not two, and it was quickly suggested by both Conservative and Labour supporters that the SDP leader Roy Jenkins- a politician often accused by his opponents of lacking any convictions to have the courage of- must therefore be the Cowardly Lion.

I mention this story because it shows how deeply this film has become a part of popular culture, so much so that a reference to it was readily understood by voters at an election more than forty years after it was made. If anything, the story is even more familiar today than it was in 1983, following repeated television showings (normally during the Christmas holidays) and the opening of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on it. In Britain at least, its fame has eclipsed that of the novel on which it is based. The story is so well-known that I won't try to summarise it here, except to say that, like ""Alice in Wonderland"", it deals with the adventures of a young girl in a bizarre fantasy world.

The film is not only well-known, it is also highly regarded; it frequently features in lists of the ""100 Greatest Movies Ever Made"". (Sometimes even the ""10 Greatest Movies Ever Made""). Certainly, it has its good points. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow, Jack Haley's Tin Man and Bert Lahr's camp Lion are all inspired comic creations, as is Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West, although several of her scenes were cut because the studio thought that they would frighten young children. There is some imaginative use of colour- the bright, vivid colours during the Oz scenes would doubtless seem unbearably hectic and strident in any realistic film, but in a film set in a fantasy world they fit in with the strange, dreamlike mood. The use of monochrome for the real world and colour for imaginary ones became something of a cliché in fantasy movies after this, although Michael Powell was to reverse this convention to brilliant effect in ""A Matter of Life and Death"".

The casting of the teenaged Judy Garland as Dorothy (supposedly a nine-year-old) made sense from a musical point of view, as she copes far better with the demands of the film's numerous songs than any child actress could have done, but children in the audience might have found it easier to identify with the character had she been played by someone closer to their own age. (Shirley Temple, six years younger than Garland, was at one time considered for the part). As an actor, as opposed to a singer, Garland's performance in this film is nothing special, but that may have more to do with the way her character is written. Dorothy is essentially a passive character who acts as straight woman to a series of comic ones. Some of the other acting contributions are not very good, particularly Billie Burke's rather wooden Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Given that Glinda is supposed to be young and beautiful, it seemed rather odd to cast an actress in her fifties in this particular role.

The film was originally intended as a children's movie, although I don't think it works very well as one. This may have been the reason why it was a box office failure in 1939; its subsequent fame has been due to repeated broadcasts on television and its taking on the status of an adult cult. When we were taken to see it as children, my younger sister was terrified by the witch and I was bored, especially during those sepia-and-white scenes in Kansas. Some of the songs, such as ""Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead"" and ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" are jolly enough to appeal to children, but ""Over the Rainbow"", sentimental corn-syrup in its purest form, has always struck me, both as a child and as an adult, as one of the most over-rated songs ever written.

Most children's films from this period had to have an improving moral, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" has two. The first- that one must look inside oneself for qualities such as intelligence, kindliness and courage- is unexceptionable, but the other, ""There's no place like home"", seems rather parochial, even un-American, given that America is a country of immigrants, most of whom moved to the New World precisely because they couldn't, for one reason or another, find their heart's desire in their original homelands.

I must confess that I am not really a Friend of Dorothy. It is not that I hate the film, or even seriously dislike it. It is simply that, like another reviewer, I cannot understand why it is so often mentioned in the same breath as genuinely great films like ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"". I am prepared to accept ""The Wizard of Oz"" as a colourful, imaginative and at times enjoyable piece of fantasy. I just can't see it as one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. 6/10",6/10,13 January 2012,JamesHitchcock,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
The Wizard Of Oz 3-D IMAX 2013 - 4 Thumbs Up with Diamonds,"Everyone knows the story. Our thoughts on 3-D IMAX.

Russell & Cissy, the Two Movie Critics rate movies based on Entertainment Value only. Follow and LIKE us at facebook.com/TwoMovieCritics

A remake and remaster of the great classic movie in 3-D IMAX with stunning detail.

It was an amazing transformation as Cissy and I were taken back in time before we both were born, August 15th, 1939 when The Wizard Of Oz opened at the Grauman's Chinese Theater.

Immediately when the movie started and the title began in eye-popping 3-D fonts with the great sound track, Cissy and I got misty eyed. Now we were seeing this movie as it was meant to be seen and that we had only seen on T.V. sets all of our lives. Seeing it on the large IMAX screen, and in 3-D was an overwhelming experience.

You see and hear things you missed all those years on TV. The detail of Glinda's ( The Good Witch's ) costume and many other costumes was amazing. The rust marks on the Tin Man's ( Jack Haley's ) body was very detailed, and later very shinny after their visit to Oz.

We also heard several adults explaining to their children some of the story line before the movie started. A new generation was being introduced to the Wizard Of Oz just as if they were at the opening in 1939.

I suggest all lovers of The Wizard Of Oz relive this classic again with their children, and grandchildren the way it was meant to be seen on the big screen.

Oz is that place somewhere over the rainbow,"'The Wizard of Oz' is a very old movie and looks awfully dated, but still has its magic and charm. To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.

The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.

Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.

The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.

Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.

To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.

The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", ""If I Only Had a Brain"" (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.

Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.

The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).

Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time.",7/10,28 December 2007,Atreyu_II,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Garland's Oz.,"The Wizard of Oz (1939): Dir: Victor Fleming / Cast: Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton: Sensational treasure about mind and imagination. Judy Garland plays Dorothy, a farm girl who, in the midst of a tornado, is spirited away over the rainbow to the glorious land of Oz. She is greeted by numerous Munchkins after her house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. This angers the Wicked Witch of the West who demands the ruby slippers, which have appeared on Dorothy's feet. To return to Kansas she must follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek help from the wizard. On the way she encounters a scarecrow who needs a brain, a tin man who needs a heart, and a cowardly lion who needs courage. Skillfully directed by Victor Fleming whose luck had him direct this film and Gone With the Wind the same year. Garland graces the screen with her innocence and beautiful singing voice that belts out ""Over the Rainbow."" Margaret Hamilton plays the menacing wicked witch whose defeat is one of the great scenes due to its simplicity. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are wonderfully cast as Dorothy's companions. Margaret Hamilton gives a menacing performance as the Wicked Witch of the west. It regards important things taken for granted. Triumphant visual wonder that renders that ""you're not in Kansas anymore."" Score: 10 / 10

Good fun to be had,"Rating-7/10

The Wizard of Oz is a classic and many consider it to be one of the best movies ever made, I have to disagree. Now don't mistake me here it isn't bad at all, it is pretty good in my opinion but I just can't say I absolutely loved it. It has it's charm and for a child then maybe they would love it but I couldn't help feel I needed to be younger to view it with such a magical view. The story is however well timed and a good length for it's kind of film and felt the ending is one of the best parts of the movie.

Now Judy Garland is great in this, and I'm not just saying that because it's her and because it's Wizard Of Oz, she is a great talent here and back in the day people must have been blown away by seeing her on the big screen. One element I absolutely loved about this was the music because that really is the highlight and produces such memorable songs you forgot were even from this film, just great great fun. It feels a bit strange at times the plot, maybe a bit too random to be properly assembled but maybe an hour after watching I personally felt joyous and filled with a happy like memory from watching the movie.

The numerous directing changes don't help and although the finished product with Victor Fleming at the helm is strong, it can at parts feel messy. I didn't like the script and that is one the major reasons I can't see this as perfection, the lines are delivered well by most but the choices of wording are poor and anything like that done today would be classed as conventional and much seen before in musicals. I can't doubt the sheer mass of the cast for putting on a good show and even though the Munchkins are barely hear able with such high pitch voices, it is people like that who make this film what it is today.

I think one big reason this is classed as so good is because of the big technological things seen in this and a new type of film that hadn't been seen before, and in such vivid colour. The sets are horrible and I mean nothing can be done about that for the times and although they are kind of sweet looking, nothing more positive can be said about the walls seen to create the backgrounds. One big thing technology wise that does work for me is the cinematography, beautifully shot and crafted well by Harold Rosson and you can see why he received an Academy Award nomination, just marvellous.

When we come on to the songs things like ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" come to mind but that isn't the only song that sticks in your head for a time after. ""Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead"" is another song famous for being a Munchkin dance and is a great song as well. ""We're off the see the Wizard"" is another absolute classic in the songbook and I can't think of any musical with so much goodness but also so many known songs, This film is lovingly crafted and so well written in the music department.

Overall I felt it to be Solidly kind of good and although as you can see I don't agree with maybe most who see it, I still very much enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it then I couldn't recommend it more to you but I will say this, although loads and loads of film fans rate this number one and critics alike, don't expect to love this as much as some do, but then again you may fall in complete fantasy like love with it.",7/10,5 February 2015,willcundallreview,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
An Old Favourite; But Not Pathetic Version of L. Frank Baum's Story,"Now don't get me wrong; I grew up watching this movie - and I quite enjoyed it then. Problem is - after seeing it again today, two important factors are quite clear about this version of the film.

The first main one is that, in regards to the original ""Oz"" books by L. Frank Baum, this one is a disgrace to them, at least by today's standards. For its time - in the 1930's - it was the first adaption of the film on screen in sound and color. There was a previous silent version, which - like its modern predecessor ""Return to Oz"" 1985 were more in line with L. Frank Baum's book, which was indeed a mile stone in regards to film.

But the problem is many of the details, and I am not going to nitpick about costumes as really that was, most likely, the only thing they could do. Ironically, like in the silent version, they opted for live people to perform the characters such as the Tin Man, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion. It must be taken in due consideration that this film should not be classified a drama film, as this IS a musical version of Frank Baum's story.

I have no idea how people would react if there was a completely faithful adaption to the books. Because the truth is L. Frank Baum's real books are very dark in a lot of places. For example - in the scene where Dorothy is a prisoner in the Witch's castle, the Tin Man, Lion, and Scarecrow are already captured and unable to help Dorothy. She becomes literally the Witch's slave and does cleaning for her, until, to cut the story short, she throws water over the witch and she melts. Another aspect was that Dorothy's shoes were not ruby; but silver.

When people see this film today; they think this is how it is in the books and that Dorothy will be all happy in Kanasas and marry 'Hunk'. Which couldn't be further from the truth.

In the second version, Dorothy comes back (and the storyline) more or less follows the sequel ""Return to Oz"" (although it too is more of a combination of two of the latter 'Oz' books).

Also there is noticed a lack of reality about the 1939 film. Again I do take into account that at the time, perhaps they could have done better and as far as technology this is what was good for then. But as of now; when you see it today - it is abhorrently... almost the word queer comes to mind. Exactly.

It is too colorful; too idealized; its too wishy washy. There is again no sense of reality at all about it. I mean, it makes sense when you read the books (if you ever did wish to read them; which I must say the books are incredible).

But the second big factor was, for one, the problem with Judy Garland. Although this made her a star, and indeed the song ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" belongs to her in a way (not merely because she created it, but because she brought sound and life to the character) - it was because the truth is in the book Dorothy is really 9 years old.

True - they did start off wanting to use Shirley Temple (which in hindsight probably would have been the best choice in regards to age); but as for heavy singing and the makeup and stunts, it was probably a good choice to use Judy. Although she was 17. Another problem factor was the relationship with the Scarecrow and Dorothy. In the book and also in ""Return to Oz""; they regard each other as friends and the relationship is quite clear. However in this - they made it romanticized. Which was wrong. To put it bluntly - especially in light that Dorothy is supposed to be a little girl, not a teenager.

Today there should be a remake of this film, in my opinion. More in line with the original books - because now we have the capability to do more realism with the characters and yet still be faithful to L. Frank Baum's work.

People are so married to this version that most reject its predecessor which, like the 1938 one, is a milestone in regards to how they can do an 'Oz' remake. Also people reject the cartoon versions (there was an animated film version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (not live action) which was perhaps the most faithful of all the films, although I believe it was a TV film - not exactly a film film.

So for all the reasons today - if you really want to see an adaption (to this date) that is faithful to Baum's books - get ""Return to Oz"" or the animated version.

Timeless,"In the fall of 2006, my husband and I saw a screening ""The Wizard of Oz"" that had a full orchestra providing the soundtrack. Never in my life had I seen a more eclectic audience: there were families with little children, adults who came alone (one woman was dressed as Glinda), teens and college students, even couples who had to have been in their '90s. Not to gush, but it's really a testimonial to ""Oz""'s legacy that it can appeal to every generation, to every age. Like hot chocolate or Mickey Mouse T-shirts, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is something you never have to worry about being too old for. There is something so comforting about the familiar story of farm girl Dorothy's journey through the strange but wonderful land of Oz, and yet it remains a wonder to behold. I still get excited when Dorothy steps out her sepia-toned world of Kansas into the Technicolor Munchkinland, even though I learned ages ago how the trick was done. I'm still overjoyed when Dorothy makes another odd yet loyal friend along her journey (hmmm, a nice message of tolerance, too!). I still cry when Dorothy bids her friends farewell (Jack Haley in particular breaks my heart). I just want to yell at the screen, ""no! Forget boring old Kansas, stay in Oz!""

Not only is ""The Wizard of Oz"" a charming, addictive classic, but it's one of the best-cast films ever. Putty-limbed Ray Bolger (""Some people without brains do and AWFUL lot of talking, don't they?""), over-the-top Bert Lahr (I haven't any courage at all, I even scare myself!""), and boyishly charming Jack Haley (""Now I know I have a heart, 'cause it's breaking."") are pitch-perfect in their respective roles as the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man. All three were vaudeville vets, and they infuse their roles with both theatrical shtick and warmth. Billie Burke is memorably twittery yet poised as Glinda the Good Witch, and who can possibly forget Margaret Hamilton's cackling, gleefully evil performance as the Wicked Witch of the West? Hamiltion's iconic, villainous image is so emblazoned in our minds, that it's easy to forget she was a former kindergarten teacher and future animal rights activist! As superb as the cast is, however, ""The Wizard of Oz"" belongs to the young Judy Garland. Garland makes Dorothy a very real character that we can all relate too, whereas any other actress would have made her one-note and whiny. She believably plays an ordinary girl in an extraordinary place, her lovely brown eyes wide with awe and wonder. And that singing voice! Long before Garland's voice became tinged with tremulous desperation due to age and hard living, the true beauty and purity of her voice comes through in ""Oz"". Garland sings ""Over the Rainbow"" so simply, without a trace of theatrics, and you're swept away just the same. It's spellbinding, seeing someone so young have the presence and talent to hold a movie in the palm of her hand. ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain the ultimate escapist classic for generations to come, and it will always be one of my favorites. It's comforting, familiar, why... it's just like home.",No rating,6 April 2007,lauraeileen894,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
A Great and Powerful Film,"Released in 1939, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classic American film that had a modest start. After its release, and for many years, it was viewed as an entertaining film but not as a great film. When I was a child, it aired on network TV once a year, around Thanksgiving. Whole families would gather around their sets for this special annual viewing.

Later, when films became more widely available, its reputation seemed to grow and one would find it included in the lists of ""best"" films. Personally, I have always loved ""The Wizard of Oz"". I have seen it so many times, I practically know it frame by frame, as I am sure many others do.

Here are some of the reasons this film should be considered great and powerful:

1. The Beginning: The first part of the film, which is filmed in rich sepia tones, includes comedy, suspense, drama, music, and the establishment of all main characters.

2. The tornado: The special effects used to create the menacing tornado are spectacular. It is still an emotionally charged element, despite our exposure to the spectacles of modern CGI.

3. The song: ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is regarded as one of the best film songs of all time. The film almost starred Shirley Temple and MGM wanted to cut the song, so we should consider ourselves lucky.

4. Judy Garland: The use of Judy Garland to play the role of Dorothy Gale added a sense of maturity to the role and to the movie in general. Her vocal talents elevated the film.

5. Frank Morgan: First introduced in the film as Professor Marvel, Frank Morgan's talents are used in a clever way through his various characters.

6. The use of color: When Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland, the screen erupts in color. It has various symbolic uses, but mostly it delineates between the world Dorothy is from and a new world where the rules are unknown.

7. The Munchkins: The strangeness of the new world and a considerable amount of charm are enhanced by this troupe and their voices.

8. The Yellow Brick Road: Not the literal road, but what it represents--an adventure of possibilities, where heroes are tested.

9. Serendipity: The fortunate way the elements of this film came together (Judy Garland vs. Shirley Temple, Ray Bolger vs. Buddy Ebsen, the use of the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", etc.)

10. The Wizard: The use of screen projection, smoke and sound produced a scary Wizard that contrasted sharply with the beneficent image suggested to Dorothy by Glinda and the Munchkins.

11. The musical score in general. The production is generously endowed with some magical musical numbers.

12. The supporting cast: Dorothy's fellow travelers seem perfectly cast to us now, so iconic are their characterizations.

13. The Witch: One of the great villains in film history, surrounded by her henchmen and her minions (the flying monkeys, terrors in their own right).

14. The script: The story is engaging. It is also responsible for a slew of iconic quotes. My favorite is ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!""

15. The director: Victor Fleming's vision produced a delightful film that can be enjoyed over and over. When we consider that he also is credited with directing ""Gone with the Wind"" in the same year--amazing!

Will continue to enthrall for generations to come!,"One of the most cherished fantasy films to ever grace the screen, ""The Wizard of Oz"" stands as a crowning achievement in 1930's film making. The special effects are highly impressive considering the limited technology available at the time, not to mention they are infinitely more endearing than most CGI effects present in today's films. The lavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help to create a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviously filmed on a soundstage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largely in part to the meticulous backdrop paintings used to add depth to the foreground. The musical numbers are quite lively & catchy -- never slowing the pace of the film -- except perhaps for the Lion singing ""King of the Jungle"". Judy Garland truly shines in her portrayal of Dorothy, perfectly capturing the wide-eyed innocence of her character. She definitely deserved the special Oscar she was awarded for her performance. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Frank Morgan as the Wizard also turn in praiseworthy characterizations. Definitely timeless in every sense of the word, this film is recommended to those of all ages  a 10/10!",10/10,7 April 2005,Vancity_Film_Fanatic,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Movie that left mark on countless generations,"This is one of those movies that will last forever. Our grandmothers were watching it while they were just little girls and our grandchildren will enjoy it as much. Its values will never be outdated. One of those that define expression ""classic"". Only a shallow viewer could consider it to be just a fairy-tale for children, because this masterpiece is much more than that and its depth covers all generations. Although it's almost 80 years old it still resists the teeth of time, even visually. Its costumes and special effects are extremely outdated but still effective. I admit, it would be very interesting to see how it would all look like with today's technology, but I think this is one of those shrines that should not be touched.

An Endurable Fantasy...Will Continue To Last For Many Years Yet...,"Probably the world's most-watched film (GONE WITH THE WIND running a close second), THE WIZARD OF OZ is an enduring, magical piece of fantasy that has permeated popular culture like no other film before or since. There are hundreds of unforgettable, instant-classic moments in the film, with the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy and Toto, the songs, Garland's dazzling ruby red slippers, sepia-toned Kansas and the closing line ""There's no place like a home!"" just a few of the wondrous delights that THE WIZARD OF OZ offers.

It is hard to believe that the filing of ""Oz"" was so fraught with problems when you view the finished product. It seems a thing of absolute perfection, with Garland's casting a stroke of genius. Her wistful interpretation of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is the stuff of legend. The spellbinding Technicolour photography is still a massive achievement, as is Oz, the utopia land of dreams and magic.

Most audiences discover the film in childhood, and they will be pleased to find out that the film is just as magical when viewed as an adult, perhaps many years later, if not more.

An old Favorite,"As a film based on a book it is very inaccurate. As a film that is an escape from the bleak greys of real life, the Wizard of Oz shines. It is both a coming of age story about responsibility and being true to oneself and a whimsical adventure. Utilizing the use of Technicolor in contrast to black and white, we see Dorothy come into her own in the world of Oz, a place where trees are offended if you take their fruit, and anything can happen. In the end Dorothy learns that she always had the ability to get home, but had to learn and grow from her adventure to reach that point. When she returns home she is reunited with her family. Sadly Toto's fate probably remains unchanged.

A magical experience.,"Young Dorothy runs away from home with her dog Toto, after a tornado hits, she's transported to the magical world of Oz.

It is such an uplifting, magical escape, it is no wonder this film is loved by so many, all age groups, it really does survive the ages.

It really is an enchanting story, and in terms of its importance in the film industry, it was a game changer, audiences must have been left speechless when this first landed.

1939, and it still looks remarkably good, the scenes where the tornado hits look fantastic, considering the technological restraints, it looks particularly good.

Judy Garland is delightful throughout, Margaret Hamilton is a riot as The Wicked Witch of The West. The performances are all so good.

The music is so well known, so uplifting, and at times pretty moving.

I wonder if they even considered for one second that their movie would be loved decades later.

Very Enjoyable,"In my opinion, you can't deny that this is a classic movie. i don't know many people who haven't at least heard of it, and don't know many people who don't like it. I used to watch it every now and then when I was young, and I knew the words to quite a few of the songs. I hadn't seen it in a while, but, I still knew what I liked about it. When I was little, I used to be absolutely horrified of the Wicked Witch, and the Tin Man was my absolute favorite character. Since then, I am no longer afraid of the Wicked Witch at all; if anything, I just sort of hate her, because she's mean. I think that it is just a good movie through and through. It's very charming and colorful, has a good deal of humor, and you can sort of get sucked in to the story easily. Of course, they changed it a bit from the book, which only a few years ago, I didn't know about, but I much prefer the movie to the book. In conclusion, I think it's a great movie, that was a pretty big deal when it first came out, with the beauty of tis Technicolor, and that everyone should watch it.

Great movie....one of the best,"I am 51 years old and can remember watching this as a child. It was a major event in our house. Staying up late to watch the whole movie was a treat. It is still a treat to watch it now. As I sit here watching it on TBS while typing this posting, you can't help but sing along with the songs. I can remember being scared to death by the witch. Her laugh gave me the heebie-jeebies. Movies from this era were so well made. To attempt to make this kind of production today would cost much more than any film made. Today computers make special effects so easy. Back then you had to very ingenious to have believable special effects. This is one of my top 10 movies off all time. It makes you feel like a kid again, and isn't that what a movie is suppose to do, take you to another time and place. Those that don't understand are entitled to their opinions, but they really don't understand the real world. The more advanced the mind, the more need for play (or fun and escape). Just my humble opinion and something to think about.

"A true classic, if ever I saw one","The Wizard of Oz is a story of a woman who discovers that there is no place like home. Granted, it is a musical, and I am not a big fan of musicals, but this film is a classic if there ever was one, and it truly is a film for all the family.

Dorothy is a teenager whose best friend is her dog Toto and she lives in Kansas during the dust bowl. To say that life was hard is an understatement, and Dorothy dreams of a better place. It is not helped that a neighbour hates her dog and wants to put it down, so she runs away from home, only to be convinced by a magician that her auntie wants her to come back. However she never gets there as she is caught up in a tornado and taken 'over the rainbow'.

Granted, this is all a dream, but to her the dream is real. Each of the characters that she meets in Oz is a reflection of one of the characters back home, and further the wicked witch is the horrid neighbour. Back home, she was told to use her brains and to have courage, two of the qualities that her travelling companions are seeking.

The Wizard of Oz is a story about a girl growing up and becoming an adult. Learning that there is truly no place like home, and that those whom she lives with love her dearly and are worried about her. Of course Toto, her faithful companion, is by her side all the time. Further, in Oz she is a hero, but this pales in comparison to her desire to return home, and that is the purpose of the quest.

True, the Wizard turns out to be a fraud, and it is interesting that Toto jumps out of the balloon that the wizard is using to get home, but it turns out that it is much easier to get home than travelling in a balloon, and we all know how she does it.

As for the music, or more so, the singing. Many movies these days have music, but it is rare indeed for the characters to burst out into song, unless the song is a part of the film. However, songs play an important role in this film, and in a way bring out the character's emotions in a way that dialogue is unable to do. Long gone are the plays with lengthy discourses, however these seem to be replaced by songs in the musicals, though the discourses are nowhere near as deep or as thought provoking as they are in Shakespeare. Still, they add much to the characters that, as I have said previously, simply cannot be done with dialogue.

Great movie for kids.,"What a great movie for kids. A 30 year old teenager from Kansas has a dog to be executed, and rightfully so, for biting old ladies in their own gardens, but the dog escapes and comes home, so naturally Dorothy decides to run away from home and meets a gypsy who unrealistically helps to convince her to go home instead of take advantage of her, and that's why a tornado begins and Dorothy runs home just in-time to see all her family and friends are saving their own lives in a shelter instead of looking for her. Soon Dorothy is knocked unconscious and wakes up to watch a movie outside her window and realises her house is inside the tornado, but amazingly in one peice!

The house then crash lands in Oz. They sure don't build houses like that anymore! Dorothy exits and suddenly can see colors. She meets a grandma witch posing as a princess who travels by a ghostly orb who tells Dorothy she just landed on someone and she's dead. Instead of being arrested tho, the entire village does a whole happy musical number of singing and dancing celebrating the murder. Obviously the whole village is in on it.

It's a no wonder the deceaseds sister is bitter at Dorothy, as she not only killed her sister and won't be charged with murder, she's also stolen her late sisters shoes. The witch tells Dorothy she's dead meat and leaves, and the old grandma witch tells her to get out of Oz while there's a price on her head, and to do so, go see a wizard 100 miles away, instead of using the stolen magical pumps she is wearing, putting Dorothys life in danager instead of offering her a simple and safe way to go home. ""Good witch""? I think not. As if being an accessory to murder isn't bad enough.

Her pumps are made of ruby. Which is glass. Which is a stupid thing to make shoes out if. If it was real, her tap dancing would shatter the glass slippers and she'd be in urgent need of a hospital to stop the bleeding.

Anyway Dorothy gets told to go it alone down a pathway they call a road stupidly, and Dorothy totally talks to strangers along the way to finding the wizard. She even makes friends with them and invites them along. She's got a bounty on her head for murder and theft, and now inviting strangers along to ask someone she doesn't know for stuff like he's santa clause. That's pretty rude of her. But, yo, wtf, bro... not one of them looks phased at Dorothy story of being an accessory to murder. Would you trust strangers whom.are this accepting of that?

She finds the wizard and he says go and steal something from the witch and he'll grant her what she wants... What a wonderful guy he is... especially when he doesn't call the cops when she tells him later they got the thing by killing the witch. He doesn't even look phased. Is murder the norm in Oz?

Anyway, turns out he's stupid and can't operate a hot air balloon to come back down after take off and deserts Dorothy. He probably just didn't wanna be involved with a bunch of murderers and thieves.

The granny witch shows up again and tells Dorothy her pumps had the power all along to take her home, to witch she deserved at least a black eye for being so decieving and manipulating, i guess she just needed to be elsewhere with an alabi when news broke the second sister was now dead. Killed over a cleaning utensil.

So Dorothy goes home, says something about everything she ever really needs is in her backyard, or something.... is there a grocery store or hospital out there?

Then she tells every one about her murderous exploits and says it mustve been a dream, but the old lady who looked just like the witch also died in the Twister, so Totos order of execution from the sheriff has been magically reversed just because the victims dead and we need a Disney ending.

If anything this movie taught me, it's that murder is ok and once done, steal their shoes.

A fantasy rooted in the landscape of your childhood.,"I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children.

The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.

That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds.

Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.

For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.

If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.

Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.

If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.

What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",No rating,30 May 2004,The_Film_Cricket,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Yellow Brick Memories!,"We all have memories of this movie as if nobody has seen this movie just yet, then they are missing out on this treasure. As it is indeed just that you see.

Dorothy played by the late, great Judy Garland, is a teenager in KS as she gets swept up on a tornado. As she finds herself in the Land of Oz. With her beloved Toto the dog, they find themselves in such a weird but happy land.

Where she runs into the Scarecrow, Tin Man,and Lion. Who are in need of brain, heart, and courage respectfully. But the Oz person is not who they seem to be. If you did not see this, near the end.

There is also one good witch and one bad witch. The latter happened to be a mean woman trying to sell off Toto from a crying Dorothy. Still really a sweet and really funny movie.

You do not get much movies like this!

"Is, and always will be, a classic for all time!","In order to coincide with the upcoming ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"", I'm going to make my own review of this 1939 classic that will be celebrating it's 75th anniversary next year (not to mention the fact that it will be in IMAX 3D this year in September). I watched it when I was a little kid and loved it as much as anyone else in the film industry. Sure, it's not actually faithful to the book, but it doesn't matter.

It did what it had set out to do and defined the meaning of a true Hollywood classic that inspired other acclaimed directors and filmmakers to do the same. The story is very original in the overall light-hearted tone, although it does have some moments that would make you feel scared(especially the Wicked Witch of the West who scared me as a little child). The scenery is beautiful and realistic and the look of the Emerald City is a sight to behold. The characters are charming and likable too. Judy Garland is a beautiful Dorothy, Ray Bolger is a terrific Scarecrow, Jack Haley is a wonderful Tin Man, Bert Lahr is a hilarious and cowardly Lion, and Margaret Hamilton is a scary Wicked Witch of the West.

The pacing moves along very nicely, but the best part would have to go to the musical numbers written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Yip Harbug including ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", ""Ding! Dong! The Wicked Witch Is Dead"", ""If I Only Had A Brain"", ""If I Only Had A Heart"", ""If I Only Had The Nerve"", ""We're Off To See The Wizard"", and more.

Overall, The Wizard of Oz is, and always will be, a classic to those who are young and old. Recommended!",10/10,31 January 2013,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE

Timeless,"""And you, and you, and you were there."" All of Dorothy's friends look at her as if she was crazy, assuring her that her adventure was just a dream. Was it really just a dream? How could it be, when it seemed so real? In Viktor Fleming's, ""The Wizard of Oz"", dream is made into reality and reality into dream. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classical masterpiece in which breathtaking design, performance and a heart-warming storyline combine to create a movie in its very own category.

In Kansas, a twister hits Dorothy's home and she is hit by a window, falling into her dreamland of Oz. We follow Dorothy (Judy Garland) on her quest for the Wizard of Oz, in the land of munchkins, evil and good witches, and many more interesting characters. The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and Tin Man (Jack Haley) are just some of the friends, with their own problems, that she meets on her way. The story is all about ""following the yellow brick road"" as ""we're off to see the wizard.""

The screenplay was adapted from Frank T. Baum's story chronicle, The Wizard of Oz. It was produced by Mervyn Leroy and acted out by a first class list of actors. Perhaps the most important factors of this movie are the Technicolor (this is the first movie in color), the songs (that you'll never forget and never get enough of), and the ubiquitous theme/moral of ""there's no place like home.""

The plot is very easy to follow and straightforward. Despite the seemingly unrealistic storyline of wizards, a land of munchkins, flying monkeys, and bad witches flying on broomsticks, viewers can't help but fall into the fantasy of it all and imagine there really is such a place ""somewhere over the rainbow."" The characters are all believable and you seem able to relate to them and know at least one person in your life like them. People love the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion for their loyalty and personal quirks, and loathe the Wicked Witch of the West for being so sinfully evil. The dialogue is also very amusing, with a deeper meaning than most would conceive at first. There are many hidden messages of friendship, loyalty, and seeing what's right in front of you all along.

The actors are very convincing as their characters, all seemingly to step right out from the original story. Judy Garland perhaps was the best choice for Dorothy because the viewer just can't help but fall in love and sympathize for her when they see those big brown eyes staring back at them from the screen. She has a raw performance in which you can feel each emotion through her expression. From the moment Dorothy opens her front door after landing in Oz and exclaims ""Oh!"" the screen is filled with bright and vibrant color, a sharp contrast from the dull black and white from a second before. The significance of this is not lost, as the use of color is artfully done throughout the movie. The Technicolor sets the film apart because it is the first picture to be in color. During the movie the ever present yellow brick road takes the viewer through a journey of colorful and unique places, like the charming Munchkin Land and eerily spooky Haunted Forest.

This film is one that's timeless for a good reason. The acting is wonderful as is the set, themes, and dramatic aspects. The ""Wizard of Oz"" was one of a kind when it first came out and 75 years later it still touches people's hearts. The movie keeps the audience's interest and you walk away from it smiling. After watching the movie, it will give you a deeper respect for what you are and have. As Dorothy says, ""There's no place like home,"" well, there's no movie like the Wizard of Oz.",10/10,24 September 2013,meg_elizabeth,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE

A cinematic musical classic,"The Wizard of Oz defined musicals for the rest of cinematic history. The perfect balance of song and story set the standard for the perfect musical movie after years of Hollywood attempts in the late 1920's. Each song is unique in its approach without becoming out of place, and each song fits the mise-en-scene perfectly. Its transition from sepia tone to full color is charming and appropriate, and the each character is lovable in their own way. The Wizard of Oz is not a movie that could be forgotten.

"Fun, Colorful.....At Least For Two Viewings","It took almost 50 years for me to finally watch this movie, and I can see why it was so popular with a nice, tearful ending to a sweet - and colorful - story. The color in here must have the knocked the socks off the audience in 1939, although there were some others in the period that were spectacular color films, too, such as Gone With The Wind and The Adventures Of Robin Hood. Nonetheless, they didn't have a ""yellow brick road"" like this one!

This film would undoubtedly be regarded by kids of the last 30 years as being way, way too corny, but that's just how times have changed. This is one of the ""kids movies"" with an adult message: there's no place like home.

After three viewings, however, I had enough of Judy Garland's whining, almost hysterical voice throughout this movie and the yellow brick road DVD wound its way out of my collection, traded in for something else that starred someone else with a less-abrasive speaking voice.",7/10,17 September 2006,ccthemovieman-1,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
"Click your heels, fly out of Kansas, and go where nobody mourns the wicked.","For my 2000th review, I felt it would be appropriate to visit the film that I saw 20 times by the time I was 20. Between countless network T.V. viewings (on my grandparent's old T.V. where everything was green, even the black and white Kansas sequences), several big screen visits, hundreds of playings of it at the video store I worked at for 10 years and numerous video covers and different DVD releases, this film has never escaped our culture, and thus my life. My favorite VHS cover was the one in red which focused on the witch and her crystal ball, but that was out of print almost immediately after its release, while the one copy I owned was the blue ""50th Anniversary"" special edition which came with a ton of extras.

While throughout grade school, I was obsessed, not only with the film, but the book too, I made a point of seeing it every time network T.V. aired it. When I first discovered it on video, I was thrilled to be able to see it without commercials and certainly without edits. I was also surprised to find out how much was edited from the film, and like Angela Lansbury quoted about the film in her documentary on its filming, ""How long is too long?"". Certainly, I would have loved to see the filmed footage of ""The Jitterbug"" rather than the home movies, but it is obvious from what I have seen that it takes away from the flow of the completed film. What would have been more interesting was the lavish sequence (seen briefly in one of the re-release trailers) of Dorothy and her friend's return from the witches' castle.

Of course, the star-making performance of Judy Garland is the heart and soul of this breathtaking fantasy, often imitated but never surpassed. She's a bit busty for the role of the pre-teen Dorothy, but her sincerity is magnetic. There was a genius behind all her madness and as sorry as you can feel for her because of all her woes, you can't feel sorry for the artist who to this day strikes a cord in non-fans, not to mention those of us who consider her the single greatest female performer of all times.

There's no better supporting cast (although much of the roles were initially mentioned for other actors), with Ray Bolger an absolute rubbery delight as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley tender and gentle to the max as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr a blubbering gem as the Cowardly Lion. No good witch was more glamorous than Billie Burke's Glinda (even all the blonde starlets in Broadway's ""Wicked""), and for pure fright, no wicked witch was scarier than Margaret Hamilton's. I became a huge fan of this wonderful character actress as a child, and to this day, I delight in finding works of hers I hadn't seen yet. Hamilton's Miss Gulch reminds me of the delightfully nosy neighbors of my childhood, and to see her in the same outfit the year later sticking her nose up to W.C. Fields' in ""My Little Chickadee"" was a comic treat.

While Fields was mentioned as a candidate for the role of the wizard, it was Frank Morgan, a stuttering gem of a comical character actor who ended up with the role. He appears in an assortment of other roles, beginning in the Kansas sequence, and later as the doorman of Oz and the doorman to the wizard, all disguised to make you think that he's actually another character, which is doubtful. Hamilton obviously is not only Miss Gulch and the Western Witch, but in the brief guise of the Eastern Witch as well. Of course, in ""Wicked"", Nessarose is a lot more beautiful than her sister, only made ugly in spirit by her change in character which didn't ring true.

In smaller roles, Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em offer wise, if distant, support to Judy Garland's Dorothy, with Grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets the Gulch Woman and Blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off. Toto is an adorable pooch, and I long for a spoof of him getting his revenge on Gulch by biting her in the tush before jumping out of the basket. So as I reflect in my journal of my journey down the yellow brick road, I must call it a lifetime of great and powerful entertainment where every character has become an important part of my child-like heart in my transition to find my own land of Oz.

MGM's much-loved classic,"Based on L Frank Baum's first book in his Oz series, and using the songs of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, with the talents of several directors including Fleming and Vidor, 'The Wizard of Oz' was the high point of MGM's 1939 output, despite originally losing money and almost losing its greatest moment, Judy singing 'Over the Rainbow'.

Dorothy Gale is a pre-teen girl caught in a storm and magically transported, with her faithful dog Toto, from her Kansas backyard to the magical world of Oz, with its yellow brick road and Emerald City. On the way she meets a scarecrow without a brain, a tin man without a heart, and a lion without courage, as well as some rather scary midgets and some flying monkeys. Her journey with her odd new companions to see the grand Wizard of Oz takes the form of a musical odyssey to the green gates.

As Dorothy, the young Judy Garland is exceptionally good ('lions and tigers and bears, oh my!'), while the roles of her three companions are ably filled by Ray Bolger (DVD outtakes show him to be an extremely agile scarecrow in the dance sequence cut from his first meeting with Dorothy); Jack Haley (replacing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and fitting the role to a t); and the incomparable Bert Lahr as the outrageously larger-than-life lion. The music is a trifle repetitive at times (especially the reprises of 'We're off to see the Wizard') but the bright Technicolor of Oz and the spirit of the thing wins over its audience. Love it.",6/10,7 September 2003,didi-5,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
The Movie is amOZing,"The Wizard of Oz is considered one of the greatest movies of all times and will forever be remembered. The best part of the movie in my mind is that there are several different characters with their own very different personalities. Another great part of the movie is how advanced the special effects were. The scene where Dorothy gets caught in the twister and she sees things fly by her window seems pretty advanced for 1939. This movie is great because of how it appeals not just to children, but adults too. One of greatest things about the film is how the mise en scene is incorporated into it by director Victor Fleming. Mise en scene is a wide array of elements seen on camera. These different elements in the Wizard of Oz include the set and how it is arranged, the characters and their different dynamics and the props used by those characters. As I have stated in my title I think this movie is amazing and it has had one of the greatest impacts on films we see today. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.

There are a lot of factors that go into making a great film and the sets are probably one of the least focused on, but is one of the most important. In the movie there are several different places that the story takes place so that means there are several different backdrops and props. In the beginning when Dorothy is in Kansas the set is set up as a typical mid western farm. The house used is your typical wooden house with a large front porch with a wooden rocking chair. The back drop has the image of a overcast day. Just from the backdrop you can tell that the weather is going to get bad. Later when the twister begins to hit the house you can look at the background and tell that there are little twisters moving around and that there are fans blowing the actors and the set to give you that twister felling. During this whole time the set has been film in black and white which gives the whole set the dark and dreary feeling. Once the house lands from the twister and Dorothy gets up and walks outside the rest of the film is shot in color which gives the rest of the film a brighter more vibrant feel to it. Now that the film is in color the director can now use certain colors in the set to set the mood of the scene. For instance the director chose to make the road yellow which is a bright, exciting color. Every time Dorothy and her friends are on that road they are being lead to the next part of the story and if they were on a simple dirt road there wouldn't be any excitement or anticipation when there on it.

Another important part of a movie is the characters and how they dress and interact with each other. The first character introduced to us in the story is Dorothy played by Judy Garland is a young farm girl from Kansas. Dorothy throughout the film has a very imaginative and curious personality. Her costume is the same thru-out the movie, she is wearing a simple flannel pull over dress. This would be a typical dress for a girl that lives in the mid west in the 1930's. The only costume change she had in the film is when she changed shoes to the ones she saw on the feet of the witch. The next character Dorothy runs across is the Scarecrow who is played by Ray Bolger. The personality of the scarecrow in this film is very flamboyant; the scarecrow had a lot of dancing scenes in the film as well. The main personality of the scarecrow is that he is brainless which is the reason why he is heading to see the Wizard of Oz with Dorothy to get that brain. The costume of the Scarecrow is very detailed, with face paint and his raggedy overalls with straw sticking out. The next character they run across is the Tin Man. The Tin Man is played by Jack Haley. The personality of the Tin Man was heartless and he was looking to ask the wizard for a heart. The costume of the Tin Man was made out of aluminum and the face paint was an aluminum color to match. The Cowardly Lion who was play by Bert Lahr was the final character to join Dorothy on her quest to the Wizard of Oz. The Cowardly lion's personality is very shy and nervous. The Lion was looking to ask the Wizard for some courage so he could be brave. The costume of the lion was a suit that had a tail and a main sown on to it. All the different characters personalities were complemented by Dorothy's overwhelming personality.

There are several reasons why this film is a classic. Maybe it's because it was way ahead of its time, but whatever the reason this film will be watched by kids and adults for many years to come. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.

A Late-Comer,"I was born the same year the movie came out, but only caught up with it the other night, mainly because musicals are not my usual movie fare. So what's left to say after 500+ reviews. I was most impressed by the art and set direction. Too bad they didn't win Oscars. The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road.

For once, MGM's habit of over-producing what's on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.

I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I've never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. It's really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers & directors) didn't spoil the outcome. Somehow, the sumptuous production with its sturdy moral all came together, and remains aptly a movie for the ages.",No rating,17 November 2013,dougdoepke,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
"There's no place like home ... no time like childhood ... no movie like ""The Wizard of Oz"" ...","Red like magical ruby slippers, yellow like a brick road to follow, green like the Emerald city, blue like a cloudless sky, violet like a floppy field  all the colors of the rainbow celebrate two magical universes with the same initials: cinema and childhood.

""The Wizard of Oz"" is and will forever be associated with a magnificent imagery, unforgettable songs such as ""Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead"", ""We're off to see the Wizard"", the catchy ""If I had..."" songs, the Munchkins' high-pitched voices, Dorothy having the feeling 'not to be in Kansas' anymore, the shrill and scary voice of a green-faced evil witch and so on and so forth. With all these elements, it's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary, the iconic ""Gone with the Wind"" from the same director. God, if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed, it's 1939, and the throne of Hollywood undoubtedly belonged to Victor Fleming.

""The Wizard of Oz"" is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations, all over the world. It's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism, plunging us in the dreamlike Technicolor vision of the enchanted land of Oz, yet concluding with the immortal ""There's no place like home"". ""Oz"" captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places 'over the rainbow' and still were deeply rooted to our home, our family. And Kansas, with its sepia-like simplicity is Dorothy's home and we couldn't be happier for her when she was finally back.

But as a set-up to this powerful finale, the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes. Dorothy wants to go home, because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm, the Scarecrow wants to have a brain, the Tin Man, a heart and needless to say what the Cowardly Lion wants. We all can identify with Dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood, fear, awkwardness, joy, sadness, homesickness etc. And watching these three adult actors and an adolescent Judy Garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days' innocence. Those were the days ruled by Walt Disney and MGM's roaring lion, when people went to the movie theaters to escape, to dream  an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film.

Speaking of my personal experience, I had ""The Wizard of Oz"" in mind long before watching the film, with the unforgettable image of Dorothy and her three friends walking along the ""We're off to see the Wizard"" song, one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while. That's the secret of ""Oz"", which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless. Any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story, on the way it ends. Take Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film, and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes. In ""The Wizard of Oz"", it's all about characters, scenes, songs, quotes, each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another, and more than anything, each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children.

Whether it's about children's adoration for their pet animals (Dorothy's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog Toto from the evil Miss Gulch) or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world, an undeniable pedagogical value elevates ""Oz"" above all the other fantasy movies. It is, for once, not a coming-of-age, but a coming-to-realization story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding, naivety, trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world, to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves (there's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard, played by the jovial Frank Morgan). And the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action: Dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning, and fear, not as a flaw, but a necessary step before learning about courage.

""The Wizard of Oz"" provides also through the wizard's character, the man 'behind the curtain', a lesson about naivety and how child's eyes can easily trust or be impressed. In a way, it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults aren't trustworthy. Of course, some of them can be really mean and the film wouldn't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, rightfully nominated #4 in the AFI Top 50 villains. The Witch happens to be a representation of Mrs. Gulch in Dorothy's dream, like most of the characters, including the three friends (farmhands in real-life) and the wizard  in a way, it helps us to keep in mind that Dorothy is only dreaming, which doesn't make her dream less impacting anyway.

And bizarrely, as we forget it's all a dream, we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects, forgetting that it was before CGI, before ""Star Wars"", that's the miracle of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and as a beautiful dream, its memory can be eternal",10/10,1 March 2012,ElMaruecan82,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
"Enchanting, almost nostalgic art!","With trepidation I decided to watch The Wizard Of Oz, for I have memories of it from when I was five, 32 years ago. My memory was of a flying house, and of a laughing witch, who didn't quite look like the witch I saw yesterday, but that is false memory for you! Of course yesterday I saw the movie as a hardened adult, as opposed to a pure innocent, so philosophically I am a different person. Even if there were no nostalgia in memory, there would have been, I feel sure, a sense that the morals of this movie would never be repeated today. We live in a world where even infants' dolls have been sexualised with makeup. Of course no time in history was innocent, but here we had a media that put warmth above ""cool"", charm above cynicism. There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz, a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood, with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch, such pleasure from movies is rare to be had, and I cannot recommend this enough, not just as an antidote to MTV-generation philistinism, but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting , the amazing sets, the imagination, the witty songs, the metaphors and the songs, all of which are perfect. I recommend showing this to all kids, it has so much more depth than the tacky, merchandising-driven modern stuff they ingest! And equally I recommend it to grown-ups, for we need this therapy more than the kids :)",10/10,19 December 2005,Jim-Eadon,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
What a great movie!,"I think everyone everywhere should watch this movie every year. Well I guess that is a bit much. I do believe, I do believe so says the cowardly lion in this wonderful tale. It has everything, black and white, a dog, a girl that can really sing, a lesson to be learned by all and of course a Wizard. I don't want to spoil this movie so if you haven't seen it I would suggest you go and buy it as soon as you can. I recently saw the re released 3 D version and thoroughly enjoyed it. What fun it was to see it in a big theater with lots of people who love this movie and it reminds many people of their childhood. I do wish there was a real place like Oz where you wouldn't have to go to work till at one but take an hour for lunch and then at two we're done! Jolly good fun.

"A great adventure, full of heart.","The Wizard of Oz is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's full of life, energy and heart. This is probably what defines the term: movie-magic. There are so many classic moments here, after all this movie is still heavily quoted in pop-culture, 75 years after it was first released! The story is basically about a girl who longs for somewhere over the rainbow, and then gets what she wants... or is it really what she wants? The movie starts (as most people know) in plain sepia color, but when we first enter Oz, it switches to full color. This is truly amazing to see, especially in the 3D-bluray release! I must admit that I was a bit skeptic towards the 3D version, but when I watched it I was blown away! I felt suck in to the movie in a way that I had never been before! So I recommend everyone to watch this movie, no matter how old you are! And if you have the opportunity, then watch it in 3D, it's totally worth it!

A real classic with strong legacy all over the popular culture,"The story is surely a classic of a family adventure fantasy movie. It doesn't have many twists and the dialog isn't that complicated. These things help the movie to be easily comprehended by kids of all ages and from all generations. This movie becomes timeless due to those factors. But I have to admit that this movie doesn't really serve my personal taste, even for a family movie. I see the acting as to inflated, making the movie enjoyable for kids exclusively while the older viewers can only find interest in the story as a whole. The acting is quite a standard work for me as all the characters looked like they kind of overdo their roles.

"Magic of The Wizard of Oz Created Through Theatrical, Cinematic and Musical Effects","The Wizard of Oz, based on the children's book by Frank Baum, was released in 1939. The screen play was written by Noel Langley and the film was directed by Victor Flemming. Judy Garland stars as the main character Dorothy Gale. Billie Burke plays Glinda the Good Witch of the North, Ray Bolger the Scarecrow, Jack Haley the Tin Woodman, Bert Lahr the Cowardly Lion, Margaret Hamilton the Wicked Witch of the West, and Frank Morgan the Wizard of Oz.

The story begins when Dorothy's house gets swept up in a tornado in Kansas and then lands in the magical world of Oz. When she steps outside of her house after the storm, Dorothy finds that her house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, and she acquires the witch's ruby slippers after she encounters the munchkins, Glinda the Good Witch, and the Wicked Witch of the West. To find her way back home to Kansas, Dorothy must travel to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz. Along her way down the yellow brick road, she meets three new friends: Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion. Together, the group reaches the Wizard and, after killing the Wicked Witch of the West, the Wizard grants the Scarecrow a brain, the Tin Woodman a heart, the Cowardly Lion courage and Dorothy a ride home to Kansas in his hot air balloon. Unfortunately, the Wizard accidentally takes off before Dorothy can get on board. Then the Good Witch of the North enters and informs Dorothy she can go home by clicking the ruby slippers together and saying ""there's no place like home."" When Dorothy returns home, she realizes she was dreaming and many of the people from her life in Kansas were the characters she met in Oz.

I think because the story was first adapted to the stage as a musical, the directors of the film used a combination of theatrical and cinematic effects to create the movie. I think the combination of these effects helped create the child-like whimsy of the story.

Many theatrical effects can be seen throughout the movie. The characters' costumes and make up, especially that of the Munchkins, the Scarecrow, the Tin man, the Lion, the trees in the forest, the witches and the flying monkeys, would also be suitable for the stage. Much of the depth in the scenes and shots that take place in Oz, such as the field of flowers leading toward the Emerald City, is created by painted backdrops and panels similar to what you would see in on-stage productions. For many scenes, the camera was also positioned to give an audience member's point of view and much of the blocking is set up similar to an on-stage production. Many of the special effects are also theatrical in nature. The melting of the wicked witch was accomplished with dry ice and a hydraulic lift that lowered the actress into the set floor, much like a trap door on a stage. The Wizard's lair was accomplished with dry ice, lighting and fire. They also created the Wizard's hot air balloon with a painted backdrop and the basket was lifted with a pulley system to give the effect that he had taken off.

However, many effects in the movie could only be accomplished by using cinematic techniques. Special effects such as the horse of a different color, the wicked witch's crystal ball, the good witch's pink bubble, and certain scenes with the flying monkeys could only have been created in the cinema. The director used the camera in a variation of shot angles, durations, sizes and movements to emphasize different actions and ideas that could not be highlighted as well in a stage production. The directors also used the camera to add to the mise en scène of certain sequences such as the shots when Dorothy is clicking the ruby slippers together and saying, ""there's no place like home."" The shot is long in duration and is a close up on Dorothy. The lens slightly blurs the focus and then eventually overlays three images together: Dorothy's face, her ruby slippers, and a starburst-like pattern. This helps add to the idea that Dorothy is crossing back into the real world from the dream world. Another major effect that was only possible in film was the switch from sepia tone to color when Dorothy leaves Kansas and enters Oz and when she returns to Kansas from Oz. This effect helps creates a distinct separation between Dorothy's real world and fantasy world.

Another effect that added to the whimsy of the story was the audio. The movie combines diegetic sound and non-diegetic sound to help tell the story. Diegetic sound such as the singing of the actors, ambient sound such as farm animal noises, the wind from the tornado and the Wizard's voice, and the character's dialogue were sources of sound found on the screen. Non-diegetic sound such as the musical score and some sound effects was sound that came from an off screen source.

A combination of theatrical, cinematic and audio effects helped make The Wizard of Oz a movie masterpiece. The costumes, blocking, special effects, camera effects and sound all play important roles in tying the story together.

Very gorgeous and beautiful - but is it the best?,"People have described this film as captivating, the best, most charming film they have ever seen. For some people there are a great deal many films they would prefer, but with no doubt it is likely every person will like this a wee bit in some wee way!

One thing to congratulate is the special effects, which a lot of people do not seem to go on about. For the film's time, the special effects were probably the most special since films were invented (to some people anyway). Of course some of the ways they made illusions were easy, but very clever. Others were harder to make, such as the tornado and the flying monkeys.

Other good points on the quality of the film are the superb acting, the way it was filmed, the scenes and the way the script was written - despite some points being not completely similar to the book.

The characters of the film are very likable, especially the main four: Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Toto the dog is a delight too.

The songs are very beautiful and entertaining - so is the fun dancing - avid young dancers may feel they want to get up and dance along with Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man as they move their feet!

One thing that just about everyone who watches this film will like, is the charm of the story and the characters, which is probably why this film has (sort of) gone down in history. Indeed this film is very likable and pretty captivating, a good job!

The film starts in sepia to capture the mood of the setting - an old farm in Kansas and the rather dreary mood. The girl called Dorothy wishes to go to some other place and to help save her beloved dog from the stubborn Miss Gulch - who wants the dog after he annoyed her. When Toto is taken away and then escapes to return to Dorothy, it is the last straw for the girl, she is going to run away... That isn't all that happens, the plot twists and turns in a dramatic way.

Enjoy ""The Wizard Of Oz""!

A Pure Delight,"This movie is a pure delight. I remember back when I was young that it would come on television once a year and whenever it played it was like watching it for the very first time. It was both wonderful and magical. Even today it is a joy to watch and having seen it at least fifteen times that in and of itself is quite remarkable. At least for me. Be that as it may, I think it is important to inform new viewers that this movie was made back in 1939 and as a result it doesn't have the computer graphics or any of the technology used today to enhance the special effects. But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as ""Dorothy""), Ray Bolger (the ""Scarecrow""), Bert Lahr (the ""Cowardly Lion""), and Jack Haley (the ""Tin Man"") and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated. In short, not only is this movie a ""classic"" in every sense of the word but I believe it ranks in the top 3 films of all time. If you've never seen this movie then by all means you need to buy or rent it as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.

One of the most overrated films ever made,"I have to rain on the ""Oz"" parade here. For the life of me, I cannot fathom why this film is so revered, and I know my films. The 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" has to be the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated ""classic"" and ""great"" film ever made.

The acting in ""Oz"" is horrible, the sets completely unrealistic always looking like they are indeed on a soundstage instead of looking anything remotely close to real (early Tim Burton syndrome), the characters are all annoying, really this is probably the most ""in your face"" obnoxious film ever. If it didn't strain SO hard to be a good film, this may have actually have been a decent ""B"" film, an early cheesy delight along the lines of countless 50's and 60's cheesy sci-fi, horror and fantasy films. But because ""Oz"" thinks a lot more or itself than it really should, it comes across as a bloated albatross of a pathetic attempt at decent fantasy.

Even the supposed ""great"" song, ""Over The Rainbow,"" is completely overrated. It's a horrible, horrible song, completely unmelodic and painful to the ears. The one lone bright spot in the whole film is the Wicked Witch, with Margaret Hamilton playing the role so well and clever she easily outshines literally everything else the entire film has to offer.

But hey, many people like the film, so that's the way it is. But speaking of this film in the same manner of real films like Gone With The Wind, Casablanca, and so many more, is a complete joke. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is probably the worst supposed ""great"" film ever made.",1/10,17 March 2002,stevenfallonnyc,The Wizard of Oz (1939),NEGATIVE
I wish I could have followed the yellow brick road.,"I remember watching this movie when they would air it once a year on CBS a few years back. Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?

I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever.

The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.

The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.

I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.

Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom.

What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie.

The music and dancing are wonderful. Roy Bolger is awesome as ""The Scarecrow"". Such talent went into the casting of the film. Such special effects for a film almost putting it way before it's time. I feel some of these effects have been carried through with future films that have been made. Each film learns from the other. I will always love ""The Wizard of Oz. Looking forward to the recent films that will continue the Oz series. I loved James Franco's portrayal in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"". Still nothing will come to the magic of the original.

We're off to the see the Wizard. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.,"In every childhood's dream, we all have been inspired to be somewhere. Some have the dream to become someone in a different place. An place where speculation is an key point in that particular environment. Some dream about being in an place, where wonder and joy filled up their imagination. When Frank L. Baum wrote the book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", his vision was much more different than the movie's adaption. In 1939, The Wizard of Oz was made into a motion picture. It is not only a motion picture for audiences, but a motion picture for all generations. The movie tells us about how Dorothy, played Judy Garland, set off on an adventure in the colorful, lively world of Oz. But, before even being situated in the world of Oz, let's start from the beginning. In the great state of Kansas, Dorothy is happily living in her little Kansas farm, with her aunt and uncle. But, an mean landlady named Mrs. Gulch has a grudge on Dorothy because Dorothy's dog, Toto, bit her. She is ignored by her guardians, who are helping out on the farm. Then, the movie strikes a major chord, and from there, The Wizard of Oz begins to unfolds as Dorothy sings the musical number, ""Over the Rainbow"". Soon enough, an huge tornado threatens Dorothy's home and eventually, Dorothy lands in the wonderful world of Oz. From there, her adventures will unfold and set the viewers on a vivid, magical, journey through Oz. Dorothy begins to make new friends with the people she comes in contact with. But, like any other fairy tale, there's always evil lurking. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to take over Oz, and so it's up to Dorothy and her friends to make it to Emerald City to see the Wizard. There are supporting characters in The Wizard of Oz that consists of The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow. Each one of those characters want to achieve something during this journey to see the Wizard. The Tin Man wishes a heart for his body. The Cowardly Lion wishes to be brave and have courage to stand up against his fears. The Scarecrow wishes he had an brain. Over time, The Wizard Oz had been broadcasts on local television stations over the last 30 years. It is till being shown on TV as of today. But, what is about The Wizard of Oz that makes the movie worth-watching? Well, there are a lot of reasons to speculate on that question. First of all, the original Frank L. Baum's novel was a dark allegory on historical figures being represented as the characters in the Wonderful World of Oz. In this movie version, those elements are thrown away. Second of all, the movie's appeal is to everybody. A lot of parents would take their kids to see The Wizard of Oz every time it is shown on TV or at the movies. In my opinion, The Wizard of Oz is timeless classic. This is a movie that is based on the tradition of magic. We, as the audience, are stunned when we see the world of Oz. Not only the set design of The Wizard of Oz is spectacular, but also, it has a juvenile feel to it. The spirit of the movie really makes the movie more pure than any other movie that is meant to seen by children. The Wizard of Oz is juvenile in its tone, especially the leading role of Judy Garland. For me, Garland is probably responsible for making the movie appeal to children. There's a deep meaning to the movie's argument on whether Dorothy's dream was real or fictional. This was significant when the movie was released in 1939. In the end, her dream is validated as being a dream. MGM was willing to gamble on The Wizard of Oz because it was the most expensive production at that time. The end result was an great-looking, very appealing and dazzling story of magic. The musical numbers in the movie are compelling and is full of joy as we hear Judy Garland's splendid singing voice that makes it all the more purer. It is a unforgettable classic that will live on for many centuries. And, also, there's no place like home. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10/10,16 November 2013,blazesnakes9,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Fantastic Score Great childhood movie,"Well what a movie this classic was. I hadn't seen this movie in years. I can vaguely recall it even. However when I went along to it, It slowly came back to me. And I MEAN slowly. The plot was quite simple, in that Dororthy(Garland) is shushwed up ie swept up in a tornado into a fantasy land. The tornado was so real like, the one in Into the Storm(Review here). It was so impressive. So anyways, Dorothy then is found in a new place and is woken up to Munchkins. Then it is found that there are TWO wicked witches. One of the East)(whom was killed with Dorothy's house) and the Wicked Witch of the West(Hamilton). The Good Witch is also there and helps Dorothy out. Dorothy wanted to return home. However she has to Follow the Yellow Brick Road. People who know me, will know my love for music in Movies. Well this one surely did not disappoint me. I was happily singing all the songs. One thing I did notice was that the songs that were being song I was saying to myself: ""Oh so this is where the song came from"". On the way to the Wizard, Dorothy encounters Scarecrow(Bolger), Tin Man(Haley) and the Lion(Lahr). She told them as she met them on her travels, that she's going to the Wizard in the Emerald City to ask to be sent back home, while so Scarecrow wanted a Brain, Tin Man wanted a Heart, and the Lion wanted Courage. So a conflict ensues with the 4 of them and the Witch. As with any childhood movie, the Winning character is always what I want all the time not the ""baddie"". Then quite a shocker for me personally. Not sure abotu the rest of yeeee, but the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion and the ""Wizard"" are all her own family. Which I was saying: ""Isn't that....."" etc., Great childhood movie. Ohhh and the quotes, just unreal. One quote: When the Lion was requesting his Courage: ""What makes a King out of a slave? Courage!"" and the most one quote that really went through me: Considering my heart was broken by my first ex: You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable."" and another quote relating to the heart: "": A heart is shown not by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others."" So the movie ended on as always with a childhood(well the one's I've seen - hhaha) on a positive note. The Wicked Witch of the WEST, had been defeated. Dorothy was heading back. It was made out to be of a DREAM.

Wonderful Classic Film,"Dorothy is played by Judy Garland, and her portrayal has lost little of its charm over the years. I honestly believe somebody watching this film for the first time would enjoy it just as much as its original audience.

Dorothy is a simple innocent girl and that's what warms us to her, and this helps us to identify with her. In addition the additional characters in the film have their own unique charms. But each one of them has enough quality for us to believe in them.

The conversion from the original book to this film is done excellently the actors that were chosen to play each part were just amazing. Maybe for people today the visual adaptation does show its age, but I for one don't care it shows thought about set design maybe missing in today's blue screen studios.

There are more recent adaptations of this film but in all honesty this one is still my favourite.",10/10,28 July 2015,oscar-nicholson,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
A classic,"While this was not the first iteration of The Wizard of Oz that I have seen, it certainly was nice to see where it originated from. Though it has a simple plot, it is old but gold, with many heart warming moral of the story. Though some parts of the film were a little odd and unnerving, given that this film was made at a time where this kind of films were very much at its infancy, it really isn't much I can complain about. It is not so much as a deal breaker but more like something to take note of. However I do believe that this is a film that would significantly cater to the tastes of some people. Unfortunately that is not mine, but I can still see that it is a good film and one that I believe everyone should watch at least once, if not for the story, then for the exposure of how monumental this film was for the industry.

Such a Magical Movie,"I love watching the classics and actually seeing every reason it's a classic in the first place. Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.

No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful. So many iconic images, moments, and words, a whimsical fantasy land, special effects (COLOR!) that had audiences in 1939 screaming and cheering. Such a fun watch, I can't get over it. I highly recommend you let yourself experience this beautiful film. I can't wait to watch it with my grandkids someday.

Classic Musical,"I saw this film when I was younger and it is just as witty and entertaining as I remember. The change from sepia tone to technicolor, then back to sepia tone was an interesting part of the movie that really shows the difference between the real world and the world of Oz. The change to color helped to give the land of oz that magical feel and really set the tone of the movie. I was pleased to see that the song-and-dance scenes actually moved the plot along in a nice way and gave the characters motivations to see the Wizard. I didn't like how some of the scenes felt a little bit too dragged on, especially in Munchkinland. I don't generally like musicals because of that factor but I was able to overlook it because it was only one scene or two and it still moved the plot forward, making it okay. I thought it was a good movie and definitely an amazing movie in its time.

A girl who goes runs away and wakes up in a new city.,"This movie is literally a classic for all generations. The different changes made it what it is today. The most memorable part for me is when the Dorothy comes out of the house and if goes from sepia to color. The plot line is good and easy to follow it's great for all ages. The Wizard of Oz is a solid memory to have as a child. Dorothy role was so strong and solid and shows what can ""happen"" when you want to run away. The effects in the movie are great, when the evil which first makes her appearance it's big and dramatic. Her entrance describes her character right then and there. When Glinda the good witch makes her appearance she comes in sweet and smoothly. That describes her character for the rest of the movie. I will always give this movie a 10/10.

Has a good message underneath the darker stuff.,"On the surface, The Wizard of Oz is a very dark and twisted tale. Dorothy the protagonist lives in the country, surrounded by corruption (for example, a mean-spirited local woman has relatives in high places, thanks to which she easily gets the local judge to sign off on an order to put down Dorothy's adorable dog Toto), crime (when Dorothy runs off to save Toto, she doesn't get more than a few miles from her house before coming across a vagrant who tries to rob her, and would've probably tried worse if the weather hadn't suddenly kicked up), and frequent natural disasters in the form of twister tornadoes. It's pretty much Hell on Earth, and it's no wonder that Dorothy is desperate to leave this dreadful place, to which effect she sings a very moving song in the beginning.

Then a development occurs which seems at first to be fortunate - Dorothy flies to the magical land of Oz, using her house as air transport. Well, the development quickly turns dubious, since Dorothy marks her arrival to Oz by killing the regional supervisor - the Wicked Witch of the East.

The local population called the Munchkins, strangely afflicted by mass stunted growth, goes ape with joy over this fact. Now, such shameless celebration of anyone's death is suspect to me. Moral people don't revel in murder so much, especially when it's a local official who is killed. But then I got to thinking: maybe this Witch had some genetic experiments going on in the area. That would explain why all the Munchkins are so underdeveloped physically. So I suppose that killing her was the right thing. When a foreign dictator flies so far off the rocker, you ice the barbaric scum. Sometimes Gandhi's methods don't work so well.

Anyway, at this point the movie starts to purposely mess with your head. Dorothy suddenly wants more than anything to go back home. Well, ""a"", we were led to believe that what she'd wanted most of all was an adventure. Now that she's got her wish, however, she just wants to return home. And ""b"", did she forget that they'll kill Toto once she comes back? Apparently so! That annoyed me extremely, because Toto was my favorite character in the entire romp. This dog was cute, and didn't blab much, unlike the other characters who seemingly did nothing else but whine about their problems.

That's basically the only type of people/beings that Dorothy gets to join her when she marches to Emerald City to get a ticket home - whiners looking for handouts. There's Scarecrow - a kind of field-based bird-bouncer who wants to magically gain cleverness. Obviously going the way of persistent studying and mental training doesn't even occur to him. Then there's Tin Man - a case of artificial intelligence gone completely haywire. He was designed for cutting wood, but must've short-circuited in a few places while rusting under the open sky, or maybe the reason his owner ditched him in the first place was because of programming defects... Anyway, now Tin Man is obsessed with obtaining a living heart, on the wild assumption that this will make him more emotionally complete. Consider the difficulty of obtaining a living heart - donor? stem cell technology? If it's genetic know-how he's after, the Wicked Witches seem to have that covered, what with the Munchkins and winged monkeys and all, so he'd be better off seeking audience with them, not some ""Wizard"" they know nothing about. Consider also the difficulty of fusing a living human heart with a metal robot. Finally, the entire endeavor is useless in principle - emotions come from the brain, not the heart. But the most ridiculous part of this is that the guy is already emotional like you wouldn't believe! All he ever does is cry.

Finally, the third minion Dorothy gains in her journey is Cowardly Lion, who is, frankly, a bouquet of psychological disorders. He is a bully, a narcissist, a neurotic, and has megalomaniacal tendencies to boot. Plus I find it rather strange that a flamboyant fellow like Lion absurdly has the mannerisms of an alcoholic dock worker.

All these freaky folks go to beg the ""Wizard"" for a handout that will solve their lives' problems. The only real ""adventure"" they encounter before getting to the Wizard is a poppy field. They become very sedated, well, the biological organisms among them do, but have no fear! The ""good fairy"" flies by and sprinkles some white powder on them, and they spring right back up and practically sprint to the Emerald City, singing on the way. You can see that all these indulgences have their effect, though - the characters have severe hallucinations while in the city. For example, one of the horses keeps changing colors.

Do you see what I mean by ""dark""? At this point I was becoming somewhat depressed by all the immorality. But luckily, towards the end the movie actually becomes much better, and teaches the viewer several very important lessons: 1. In this world, external attributes and illusory things are at least as important than actual inner qualities, and sometimes more so. The Wizard uses a college diploma, among other things, to demonstrate this, because, indeed, in our society a useless piece of paper like that will open at least as many doors for a straw-brained guy like Scarecrow as actual mental ability. 2. It teaches people to be realistic. The land of Oz turns out to be just a fleeting fantasy that Dorothy had. The movie thereby says, and rightly so, that you should accept reality for what it is, and then work to change your circumstances - not wish for magical freebies. Consequently, I'd even say that there's a strong anti-religious message here, and for that alone, I forgive Oz all of its apparent flaws.

Unbelievable and overrated,"Let me start by saying I saw this movie on the same night as 3 other (completely different) movies: the Japanese AFTER LIFE, Kubrick's early work KILLER's KISS and horror-classic DAWN OF THE DEAD. And like many other ""classics"", this one just doesn't do the trick for me. Right, you have to watch these films(other example: THE SEARCHERS with John Wayne) with an open mind and from the point of view of years ago. I can accept that, as I can also accept the other style of acting and film-making. But what should really make such a film timeless? Right, the story. And this film just has one of the most ludicrous stories in movie history, even for a fantasy: not once have I even smiled(besides with the bits that were later used to parody in THE SIMPSONS, AFTER HOURS, NAKED GUN,etc.), not one moment was there a feeling of suspense(the characters were simply never in danger), not once did you get involved in the story and, most of all, the story was filled with gaps. The film however has some beautiful scenery and though I'm not a big musical fan either, I found the songs rather enjoyable. But, in my opinion, that just isn't enough for a film to be called a classic. ""Old"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good""! 5/10",5/10,27 February 2000,PeterJackson,The Wizard of Oz (1939),NEGATIVE
a milestone,"People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on ""the big screen."" That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.

I guess the part that ""gets"" me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply (""...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place...""), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?

Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual ""go see this movie"" mantra.

I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.

I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a ""growed up"" (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.

People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.

Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!

Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.",No rating,12 November 2004,rzajac,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
The Wizard of Oz Review,"The Wizard of Oz was my all time favorite movie when I was younger! After giving this movie a fresh look, after not watching it for a few years, I still noticed that there were those few parts that I absolutely loved! I think the special effects in this movie are great! I loveeeed when I was younger, and still do, the color changing horse! I also liked the entrances/exits of the Wicked Witch with the smoke/fire! Another great special effect is in the very beginning when the tornado hits and the lady is riding by on her bike, and as she passes the window, she gradually gets closer to it; at the closest point she turns into a witch. I love the fact that Dorothy's uncles in the beginning are the same characters or representative of the same characters as she finds down the yellow brick road (scare crow, tin man, and the lion). I also like the whole general meaning of the movie. I think that it is a great children movie because of this. It teaches you that you have to look within yourself to find the parts of you that you are missing; you can't just expect someone to give it to you. Overall, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!

Oh it always makes me cry....,"How can anyone give this film less than 10/10? This should be number one film. It's not only magical and amazing and beautiful in a colourful, feel good way, its filled with talented actors, joyful songs and amazing characters.

If you haven't seen it you must be mental. Go and see it. For a 1930's film the picture is amazing.

How it goes from a black and white old sad picture to being the most colourful, bright, energetic thing on TV.

Margaret Hamilton, The wicked witch of the west, once told a magazine before the film was out to stop ranting on about The Wizard Of Oz and focus on her other films as she thought the Wizard Of Oz would never make it big... Well look at it now.

Worth every second of watching. It seriously makes me cry thinking of how much magic it brings to my heart and the world...

Timeless and Immortal,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, not much. But it seems a sin that I've never written a review for the most beloved film of my childhood. So I'll do my best to keep this original.

I first saw the film, like many others did....when I was very young. It was probably the very first feature film I ever laid eyes on. Since then, it's been my most watched film. I have very distinct memories of watching it as a very young girl. No less than 4 or 5 years old and being absolutely entranced by it. I know every line of dialogue by heart. I could quote the film forwards and backwards. Needless to say, I am extremely familiar with it.

Even as I got older, I never lost my respect for it. I always felt it was special, even in my teenage years. This film is my safe haven when I'm sick or mentally unwell. It instantly comforts me with warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia. I put it on and suddenly I'm a kid again.

I cannot help but smile while watching it. I am a fully grown adult woman now. But that doesn't make me anymore immune to the film's wonderful charms. The Wizard of Oz can melt the heart of even the toughest critic. Of that I am dead certain.

But how does it hold up today? Well, I'm sure you can already guess my answer to that. This film does not show it's age. It's well paced, well acted, well scripted and well designed. Be it 1939 or 2016, it made no difference. Time has not varnished this classic film. Not. One. Bit.

Is it a perfect film? No. In fact, there are a few scenes I would omit. However, I feel it would be inappropriate to rate it any less than 10 out of 10. And the few errors that are present, I can easily forgive. Just because a film is imperfect does not mean it is any less deserving of praise. There is, after all....no such thing as a perfect film.

This is definitely a feel good movie. It's also highly addicting. You can watch it over and over again and never grow tired of it. Such rare magic was captured on the screen here that I doubt will ever be caught again. The songs will stay with you forever, as will it's wonderful, underlying message. Because whenever I turn this movie on, I feel like I'm home again. And as we know....there's no place like it.

Great film for the whole family!,"**SPOILER ALERT**

The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it all these years later because its underlying story hits home with us. It undoubtedly penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of our childhood, stirs them and then, finally, reassures them. As adults, we love it because it reminds us of the journey we have taken since first viewing the film. The Wizard of Oz fills such a large space in our imagination. It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't. To this day, each time I watch The Wizard of Oz, I pick up on different small details that I had not previously noticed.

The film takes us along on a journey that young Dorothy, played by actress Judy Garland, and her little dog Toto embark on after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a twister. They are taken to the wonderful Land of Oz After having offended the Wicked Witch of the West, played by Margaret Hamilton, Dorothy is protected from her wrath by the ruby slippers that she obtains. At the suggestion of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, played by Billie Burke, Dorothy heads down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City, where dwells the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who might be able to help the girl return to Kansas. On her journey, she befriends a Scarecrow, played by Ray Bolger, a Tin Man, played by Jack Haley, and a Cowardly Lion, played by Bert Lahr. The Scarecrow would like to have some brains, the Tin Man craves a heart, and the Lion wants to attain courage. In hopes that the Wizard might also be able to help them too, they accompany Dorothy on her journey to the Emerald City.

Of all the years I have been watching The Wizard of Oz, I had never previously picked up on the importance of the change from black and white to color. The switch from black and white to color had a very important role back in 1939 when this film was first made. Up to this time-frame, films were still primarily done in black and white until the prior release of another classic. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was made in 1937 and it pioneered the idea of a color animation feature. With The Wizard of Oz following its release and combining both black and white and color filming, it was sure to be a classic.

The Wizard of Oz began one way and ended in another completely. Richard Thorpe was the original director of the film but was fired after only 12 days on the job. Next came George Cukor, who lasted just three days. When Victor Fleming took over, things were finally progressing. Not only were there direction changes, but there were also cast changes that took place. The actor, Buddy Ebsen, who was originally the Tin Man, had to be replaced after having an allergic reaction to the silver makeup involved in the costume. He was replaced by Jack Haley.

The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. How does it manage to still shine, when others falter year after year? It has a lot to do with the dynamic cast, heartfelt songs, and eye-catching special effects. The story of The Wizard of Oz shows us how young Dorothy is learning about evil, friendship, and fallibility. The message in this film along with its presentation is why people of all ages continue to view it time and time again all these years later. I don't see this changing any time soon. The Wizard of Oz will remain a family classic for many more years to come.

We're off to see the wizard.,"This technicolour triumph tells the time-old tale of Dorothy, a young girl who gets whisked away to the magical land of Oz and must find a way back to Kansas with some help from a few friends she picks up along the way. 'The Wizard Of Oz (1939)' is a colourful, quite energetic musical that's as iconic as they come, practically etched into the memory of every cinema-loving person regardless of if they've seen it all the way through or not. The flick has some legitimately entertaining sequences and its aesthetic really is distinct, brought to life with stellar set-design and creative costuming that almost pops off the screen. It does sag a little in its mid-section and it isn't exactly complex when it comes to its themes. In a way, its story is a little too straightforward. Plus, its sanded edges make for a somewhat 'vanilla' experience. Still, the picture is mostly enjoyable and is practically the definition of escapist fantasy. 6/10

There's No Place Like 'OZ',"i love 'Oz'. and NO i do'nt mean some stupid jail cell. anyone who associates 'Oz' with a prison should probably be locked in one. Just like 'candyman' from 'Willy Wonka' doesn't mean some scary black guy spewing bees from his mouth. Jeez. i can't believe some of the connections i've heard people make over the years.

i'm not going to say much because there's not much more you can say about this film that the fan base hasn't already gushed out with enthusiasm.

the songs and dialogue are great. in fact they are extremely witty and totally hilarious. people underestimate how truly funny this film really is. they often play up the sentimental elements and forget how truly funny all this really is.

not to mention how nightmarish and disturbing it all gets. i don't know about you all, but the flying monkey's and the wicked witch still scare the heckameyer out of me.

A good movie,"This a good movie. 8.1 is overrating to just a little. But still a good movie. I can't help but laugh when I think of people being scared of this movie. Oz the great and powerful is a little better. The return to Oz is a little bit better. The Wizard of Oz (1914) is better. The Wizard of (1910) is better. But still this is a good movie. It has a great story line. It is kind of campy. But still this is a good movie. Yes a fun fantasy film. I think the flying monkeys are very funny. I can not help laugh at them. This movie does belong on a best movie list. Stop putting on a scariest movie list. It does not belong there. It is a good family movie. I do not see why kids should be scared of it. I have to laugh at adults who are scared of it. See this movie it is a lot of funny.

..what else to say ?..,"No one can imagine what a sensation ""Wiz"" made at its original release. I was there - I saw it - and, quite frankly - I was not a child, even then......no one you knew had a penny, and could hardly afford the $1.25 I paid to see it. Many reviewers talk about ""65 years"", etc., much longer by now.......

It was sheer magic - even to older survivors of the great depression. It took many adults back to a magical dream of a childhood become too-long bleak by the lack of money, just as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was a testament to grinding poverty. That it has preserved so many factors of life and has endured through the decades since its release, what a inspiring document to people of all ages.

Much has been written about the three-line process of recording color on film in the late 30s. It's this startling revelation to the eyes, this brilliance on the senses which make those films which used it so indelible on the mind and heart. This brilliance is far above the ""natural"" colors we see in today's movies.

Although the entire cast could hardly be assembled today, no individual's names is necessary to make ""Wiz"" the most healing-of-the-soul movie it is. No matter your age, close your eyes and it will play for you. It may be a fairytale, but if only life were more like it. Wherever, see it.......

My guess is that this is not what the writer of the book envisioned.,"The film has a certain charm about it and considering the time period it was made in it was a very well made film. However, I am betting the writer was not envisioning a musical with people dressed in what looks like Halloween costumes. Once again for the time I am sure they did the best they could, but looking back on it the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin man, and the Lion just are not that impressive, granted they are great for a child to see as that sequel that Disney put out years later had some freaky stuff that spooked me as a kid. That would be more my style now so that is why I am commenting about it, I am not really wanting to disparage this film it is just that my tastes have changed and this is not going to be a movie I can really sit through now. However, I remember it fondly from my childhood so I give it a seven which is a rather good mark to me. The witch was excellent, I do not know who played that part, but she convinced me that she was the bad witch. And while I normally do not care for musicals, the songs in this film were nice and catchy and did not detract from the film as the song sequences in other films tend to do for me. The cast is good, though I do not think Judy Garland should have been Dorthy. She seems to old for the part and at times it seems a bit strange when she is talking as she is talking like a twelve year old and she looks like she could be in her twenties. She has a nice singing voice though so that makes up for it a bit. All in all a good film, I would suggest a remake that had more edge to it, but I figure they would screw it up royally. I do want to try and find that ""Return to Oz"" movie though as I hear it was rather dark and at times had very frightening imagery.",7/10,1 February 2010,Aaron1375,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
A good movie,"You follow your own yellow brick road and choose what way you want to go. The writer did an amazing job with putting parallels into the story. I like how in the beginning of the movie there was a short story about Dorothy and her life and after she was bumped her head and went to Oz, the same story was told but in much more detail. If I were to write a story with parallels this movie would be a great example to look at. Part of the parallel writing included having the main characters show up in Kansas and Oz and the non main characters only showing up in Kansas or Oz. The workers on Dorothy's aunt and uncles' farm in Kansas were also in Oz. The worker that told Dorothy to have a brain was the scarecrow, the worker who told Dorothy to have a heart was the tin man, and the worker who told Dorothy to have courage was the lion. Mrs. Gulch from Kansas was one of the wicked witches and the professor Dorothy met when she was trying to run away was the wizard. The non main characters were mainly in Oz, for example, the munchkins, flying monkeys, and the soldiers the wicked witch had.

When Dorothy landed in Oz and was given the shoes I did not think the shoes were going to be a big deal. Turns out, the shoes show Dorothy's' inner struggles and she has to decide if she would be a good witch (make good choices in life) or a bad witch (make bad choices in her life). She has temptations from the bad witch; however, she did not give in. When Dorothy finally woke up in Kansas she was a completely different girl. Before, she took people for granted liker her aunt and uncle and she tried to run away. When she woke up, she showed them respect and love which shows she chose the inner good witch. If she came back and was still disrespectful and took them for granted she would have chosen the inner bad witch.

In this movie Dorothy had a mentor that watched her and only helped her when she really needed help. Glenda, the good witch, was Dorothy's mentor and Glenda wanted Dorothy to choose her own paths. When Dorothy was following the yellow brick road and there were three ways to go Glenda did not tell her what way to go, Dorothy had to make the decision. Dorothy needed help the most when she fell asleep due to the poppy flowers so, Glenda helped by making it snow to wake Dorothy up. Glenda only helped Dorothy this time because she fell asleep and would not wake up. Since she was asleep, Dorothy could not go on and follow the path.

The wicked witch of the west wanted the shoes her sister, the wicked witch of the east was wearing. By the way the wicked witch of the west was acting, she did not care that her sister was dead because she only cared about getting the shoes. When the shoes appeared on Dorothy's' feet, the witch of the west became very angry and disappeared with intentions of getting the shoes. The wicked witch of the west was watching Dorothy throughout her journey and when Dorothy started to get close to the castle, the wicked witch tried to stop her by putting a poppy field in Dorothy's way to make her sleepy. However Glenda helped Dorothy and Dorothy made it to the castle. Dorothy had to go to the witches' castle and the witch ended up kidnapping her. The witch realized that she could not make Dorothy give in so, the witch gave Dorothy an choice, either give the witch the shoes or Dorothy's dog would be taken. When musicals have a happy ending, the good characters rise and the evil characters fall and in this musical, Dorothy rose because she became a better person who showed respect and the wicked witch of the west ended up dying.",5/10,2 October 2012,ctimmons-492-149018,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
A comment to the few absurd reviews and silly questions.,"I just finished reading most of the 100+ IMDb reviews of ""Wizard of Oz."" It is clear that the vast majority of reviewers rate this as one of the best films of all time, an evaluation I agree with. But there are a small few reviews which criticize it harshly. And some just ask simple questions. The following addresses this.

SPOILER - First off, once you've seen the entire film you realize the whole visit to Oz was Dorothy's dream. During the storm a window frame blew into her bedroom and knocked her out. The house was not swept up by the tornado. When the storm passed, and everyone else came out of the storm cellar looking for Dorothy, they found her on her bed, unconscious. While she was unconscious she had the dream of going to Oz. All the strange people she met, all the strange places, were all things she imagined. It was all set up during the first 10 minutes or so, in conversations with her family members, and the fortune teller she met when she attempted to run away right before the storm.

Why dream of going to Oz? Recall that Dorothy was being hassled by the wicked rich woman who wanted to kill her dog, and family members wouldn't give her the time to talk about anything. They were all too busy. She sang about finding a place ""over the rainbow"" where everything would be wonderful. When we go to sleep with a lot on our mind, we often have very vivid dreams about it. Her dream of Oz was the playing out of her imaginary place over the rainbow. But her dream eventually made her realize that such a place was not where happiness resided, but instead within her and her family, ""there's no place like home."" And then, she woke up.

So, do all of us dream too? Sure we do, if we are normal. Do all things in our dreams make sense once we wake up? Of course not. Then why should we expect anything different of Dorothy's dream? Why didn't the good witch tell her early on she could get back to Kansas by clicking her heels? Because there was no good witch. It was all part of Dorothy's dream, therefore she would have to get angry at herself. Now, do you see the absurdity in criticizing any part of the movie's plot? Or talking of ""plot holes?"" Dreams are dreams, and are not expected to bear a strong relationship to reality.

I don't believe everyone should consider ""Wizard of Oz"" a great film. Tastes differ. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" are great films. But I do believe everyone should realize when certain comments just don't make sense. Because it was a dream, the story cannot have plot holes. Why could the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion talk? Because it was a dream. The dream of a 15-year-old girl. Accept that, and any questions you may have suddenly make perfect sense.

Iconic American Cinema,"This is a definite 10/10. It is movie history. I don't know why anybody would rate it any less. Based on L. Frank Baum stories, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto are swept up to the land of Oz by a tornado. Together with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow, they must follow the yellow brick road to find the Wizard of Oz while being hounded by the Wicked Witch of the West.

The colorful visual Technicolor is the best of the day. The iconic songs, and the fun amazing story are just some of what makes this movie great. Not only is it a great movie, it's influences stretches far and wide beyond just a film. It's a cultural standard like Homer or Shakespeare.

A Film For All Ages,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for ""The Wizard of Oz"" which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's ""Gone With The Wind,"" which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting ""The Wizard of Oz"" win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie ""Twister"" from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as ""We're off to see the Wizard;"" ""If I only had a Brain;"" ""If I only had a Heart;"" ""If I only had the Nerve;"" and everyone's favorite ""Over the Rainbow."" The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more ""OZ"" movies that appear on the big screen as ""The Wiz"" based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more ""OZ"" movies that were made by Disney such as ""Return of Oz"" and ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say ""There is no place like,"" to me I say ""There is no great OZ movie like this one."" I give ""The Wizard of Oz"" a perfect 10 out of 10.",10/10,15 August 2014,moviemattb,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
The best fantasy of all time,"I have seen The Wizard of Oz lots of times and never tire of it. It has to be the best fantasy movie ever made.

A twister sends Dorothy, her dog Toto and their home to the magical land of Oz. When there, she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North, some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West, she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way, she meets up with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard, she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West's strange monkey-bat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard, who gives the Scarecrow his brain, the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying ""There's No Place Like Home"" but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.

The best song in the movie has to be ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.

Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.

This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon, not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it. The VHS copy I own also features some extras, including one on the making of the move.

Rating: 5 stars out of 5.

Immortal,"It's hard to overstate the true significance of this film. The Library of Congress informs us that it is the most watched film ever made. Its signature song, ""Over The Rainbow"", written for the film, didn't merely win the Oscar for best original song of 1939. More significantly, decades later the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts both voted this song as the number 1 song of the twentieth century. The American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest movie song of all time.

But the film's accolades go on and on. It is one of only a few films listed in UNESCO's ""Memory Of The World"" Registry. Even in a supporting role, actress Margaret Hamilton turned her Wicked Witch into American Film Institute's 4th-greatest villain of all time, behind Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates, and Darth Vader. All of the main actors and many people responsible for the film's technical achievements have received and continue to receive innumerable awards and honors seventy years after the film was released.

From its inception as a children's book in 1900 by author L. Frank Baum, the simple story was retold countless times in novels, stage presentations, and other forms, in many subsequent years, including: 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1933, and 1938. But it was the film of 1939, directed by Victor Fleming, that propelled the story into immortality.

With its perfect 3-Act structure, the script creates iconic characters and iconic dialogue. Some lines have morphed into cultural clichés, they are so often repeated. How many times has the line ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more"" been borrowed by hack writers to use in their hack scripts? I think it was Oscar Wilde who said: ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness"".

At a deeper level than the well-known story, the film's many allegories have been and will continue to be debated by scholars. Many of these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers, especially in an age when subtlety has been rendered a forgotten art. Is the naïve Dorothy really the American people? Does the yellow brick road symbolize the gold standard? Is the Emerald City a symbol of materialism that we in the early 21st century might equate to Wall Street?

A deep, intellectual script it may be, but the film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal to the heart. It's the visuals and music that render the film so beloved by the world.

And when you join the simple, yet intellectual, story with the power of great visuals and great music, you create a timeless expression of the human experience. The summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam, and no matter what joys and friendships you may experience along the way, after all and in the end, there's no place like home.

It's almost impossible to view this film objectively, critically, so magical, mythical, and powerful has it become. It's a film that does not require a plot summary; it's too well known for that, too burned into our collective consciousness.

Academy Award films, well-made classic films linger with us. But ""The Wizard Of Oz"" isn't just another Oscar winner or classic film. It is unique, its own category, a one-of-a-kind artistic expression. There will never be another film quite like it. If humans are still around a thousand years from now, someone, somewhere, using some form of futuristic technology, will be watching it, enthralled by its universality, its timelessness.",10/10,28 August 2017,Lechuguilla,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Wait a minute!,"So they all make it back to the wizard having defeated the Wicked Witch of the West. Thanks to Toto they find out the Wizard's just an ordinary man. He bestows open the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion their respective trophies to show them they had what they were searching for all along and offers to bring Dorthy home in his hot air balloon. As they are taking off Toto jumps out and Dorthy cases after him so they miss the ride but the good which appears and said she could go home all along by clicking her heels together and wishing to go home. I don't know why the bitch, excuse me witch didn't tell her sooner. I mean it's like she's having Dorthy be her hit-man, killing all the other witches so she can rule Oz with a cotton-candy fist. Anyways Dorthy awakes at home in her bed and realizes that the only place she ever wants to be is with her family at home. What a happy ending... wait a minute I feel like we're forgetting something... that's right Toto is still going to die! Everything that happened here is because Toto bit Miss Gulch and she's going to have the sheriff put him down! To me this is just to big of a plot hole to have. Did they think no one would really notice so they just left the issue unresolved? It seems like Miss Gulch isn't the type of person who'd let this go either. So for me this happy ending was soured by the fact that relatively soon Toto's going to be brought out back and shot. The last thought I had during the film was, ""I hope you've had a fun last day in Oz Toto because your about to take one final trip to the great beyond.""

Like viewing a favorite memory,"I've avoided commenting on this film because for me, reviewing such a personal part of my childhood seemed impossible. Before vcrs/dvds, children gathered once a year in front of their televisions and held their breath. The seasonal showing of this film was an event not to be missed and I was no exception.

Basically a surreal dream, the story moves with an excellent pacing that has delights at every turn. The Kansas scenes are cleverly timeless, no one talks on a telephone or drives a car for instance and the tornado is a miracle of cinematography. Totally fake, it looks very, very real. Whoever thought of the dual roles deserves a big tip of the hat.

Everyone in this film is stellar, but personally the two actors who stand out from the pack are Garland and Hamilton. After so many years I can't imagine anyone else as Dorothy. Garland plays the role wide-eyed and full of conflict, frustrated at every turn she soldiers on and we fall in love with her. Then there is the great character actress Margaret Hamilton. I confess she was the reason I loved the film as a child when most children were terrified of her. Bigger than life, almost unhuman, Hamilton steals every single scene she is in. The combination of Hamilton's stern schoolmarm look and the brilliant costume by Adrian forever defined the perfect witch. Balancing the hat and dragging what looks like a very heavy cape creates a unique movement that is both grand and menacing. Forever remembered for this iconic role, it's a shame Hamilton wasn't recognized in her career with an honorary Academy Award.

MGM obviously took advantage of the enormous sound stages. The Munchkinland set is mind boggling, weird and wonderful. Likewise the Emerald City with it's glamor gals (who date the film more than anything else)and the delightful ""horse of a different color"". The Great And Powerful OZ is still one of the coolest special effects ever.

The musical score is beautiful, the lyrics to the songs corny but fun and memorable. Over The Rainbow of course stands alone and is probably the highlight of the film. The song foreshadows but also shows the turmoil within Dorothy (and later came to represent the turmoil within Garland). It's one of the most quintessential songs associated with a performer.

Thankfully restorations have improved the quality of the print; the first section is presented in it's original sepia tone and the sound is crisp. This film is an American treasure, entertaining young and old for decades. I find it hard to believe that someone might not have seen it, but if you're out there and you're reading this, set aside some time, get comfortable and share a memory.

An institution on television.,"For me, OZ wasn't a movie so much as it was a family ritual. It was so embedded in my childhood and puberty, that I no longer thought of it as a movie- especially since it had an annual pilgrimage on television. I was still in diapers when it aired on CBS- the first time. That network's contract with the film only lasted until 1967 (I was just five then), and then the film switched its airings from CBS to NBC between 1968 and 1975- though CBS would take it back and air it yearly until the end of the 20th century. I watched it during the NBC period, and it was always introduced with the NBC peacock- with a special reminder that the first 19 minutes were in black and white. We would always circle the date on the calendar, and it always seemed to be a Spring broadcast, usually on Easter Sunday. And when the tornado sequence ended with the house crashing down, you could hear a pin drop in our living room. My favorite part of the film- since I was five- is watching the film change from b/w to the color of Munchkinland simply by opening the front door. (I saw the film years later as a college student in a real theater, and this scene actually brought whistles and applause from the audience!!) That's what I remember the most. When it left network television, I purchased the DVD.",10/10,4 November 2002,movibuf1962,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
An excellent film but pales in comparison to the Baum book!,"I finally watched ""Wizard of Oz"" last night, mostly motivated by the fact that I had just read the first two Oz books by L Frank Baum. I am always leery of anything made by Disney as they have a really annoying habit of changing the plot to suit themselves and this movie was no exception.

For example, the first 20 minutes of the movie is NOT in the book at all! The book starts with the house getting swept away by the tornado - so how come we have Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" to her pet rat (sorry, dog)? Then we have that pointless steal the dog, Dorothy running away, Professor Marvel telling her her mother is ill....blah, blah. Get on with the story for Gods sake. Baum is probably turning in his grave by now.

And all the characters in Kansas appearing as characters in Oz! That is pure Disney invention! Again, NOT in the book! Sorry but I am a purist when it comes to book adaptations. I strongly feel that movie studios do not have the right to re-write books. Either follow the book or don't follow it at all.

When Dorothy finally gets to Oz, the movie starts to improve a great deal and things more or less follow the book (except all the singing which was obviously inserted for Garland's benefit).

Considering that this movie was made in 1939, you've got to accept in 2007 that things in the movie (such as special effects) are going to look very dated (I mean, it's obvious the witch is climbing down through a hole in the floor!!). Plus the backgrounds are so obviously fake (painted pieces of wood!). However, if you can get past all that, this is still an excellent movie to watch.

But nothing beats reading the original book.

Missed the hype,"When I first viewed this movie as a child, I thought it was okay. As an adult I'm not the least bit moved. Great use of light, color and overall mise en scene, yes. The storyline didn't captivate me at all. I was kinda just watching to see what happened not because I was interested. Song selection was decent. Editing was great.

What else can I say?,"This is one of the few films that just about everyone I've ever known has seen. So much has been said about it before that there's almost nothing left to say. Having said that, what else can I say than that ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is perfect? This classic seems to endure from age to age, generation to generation. So what is it about this film that works so well? The plot is ridiculous beyond all reason, but that's not the point. There's something about the film that makes me cry at the end every time. This is the film that teaches us to believe in who we already are, that ""There's no place like home."" There's also themes of the power of friendship, courage, etc. Combined with ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""The Yellow Brick Road,"" and more of the best original movie songs ever written, everything about this film works. It's humorous (""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain""), touching, entertaining, and 100% engaging. In my opinion, probably the best film of 1939, maybe even slightly better than ""Gone With the Wind."" If you're one of the handful who hasn't seen this film, you've truly missed out. It's not just a classic; it's an American past time. Absolutely perfect.

Oz- life's lesson's for children of all ages.,"""The Wizard of Oz"" a MGM's adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has become a beloved movie standard which is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. This classic movie touches the heart and invites each viewer to relive a childhood sense of wonder and adventure. How many have grown up having viewed this 1939 movie not necessarily recognizing its cutting edge impact during the transitioning from black and white to Technicolor? It is interesting to contrast other musical adventure cinema to The Wizard of Oz. More recent movies such as Annie, The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins do not capture and stretch the imagination holding dear specific scenes to our hearts as does the story line and characters in Oz. The songs that each of the character sings along the journey to Oz representing meaning and inspiration to us individually. ""If I only had a brain"", ""If I only had a heart"", ""If I only had the nerve and were king of the forest.""

Judy Garland who portrays Dorothy lends a heart touching and melancholy singing of ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" that draws the viewer into her dream filled story. Dorothy ultimately finds true happiness by realizing that everything we seek in life is found in our understanding of home which she possesses all along. The movie stresses core components of 1930's belief systems (these seem to be diminishing in today's families) that of the importance of love, heart for others, brains, and courage. The Land of Oz and Dorothy's journey along the yellow brink road symbolize both the joy, challenge, and dangers faced when seeking the wisdom of our life's understanding and ultimate happiness. The movie also demonstrates the importance of friendship and relationship with others as we face life's struggles. The characters who play a part in her life at the farmhouse and along the yellow brick road are represented by Ray Bolger portraying 'Hunk' / The Scarecrow, Jack Haley portraying 'Hickory' / The Tin Man, and Bert Lahr portraying 'Zeke' / the Cowardly Lion. Each actor gives us endearing and memorial lines that remain etched in our childhood memories.

From a technical standpoint the scenes are focused on the characters where there is dialog. It appears that with each scene the camera shot breaks with a distinct transition. The editing of each individual scene has natural progression and follows the poignant storyline. Yet I didn't feel that the editing was so much smooth as it was natural in terms of following the dialog, flow of song, or background sounds. For that time period the editing appears smooth yet in comparison to today's computer generated 3D and High Definition technology it appears choppy and a bit disjointed at times. In many ways given the time period the editing and follow of scenes are very effective. The story and adventure are certainly geared toward the youth. However the costumes make up and music certainly keeps adult audiences interested and engaged. The visual appearances and disappearances of the wicked witch are done well given the time period. The visual of color when entering the dream sequences of The Land of Oz definitely adds great contrast impact and makes each scene more dynamic. Everything described from the yellow brick road, ruby slippers, emerald city pertains to vibrant color. The film provided realistic imagery to the eye even though this is very much a fantasy dreamlike setting.

From my perspective it might be scene where Margaret Hamilton who portrays Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch of the West and Dorothy (Judy Garland) that leaves the lasting memory and underpinning theme of the journey. How more visceral can the director demonstrate innocence and purity defeating unhappiness and evil? How poetic this visual demonstration of simplify pouring water on the evil in life proving they are just all wet. Even more importantly is Dorothy who demonstrates humble compassion as she accidentally throws the bucket of water on the witch in an attempt to save the scarecrow from burning up. The effective believability of the dim lit background coupled with the effects of colored smoke and a slowly shrinking witch screeching ""Oh No I'm melting. The screenwriter and director Victor Fleming along with special effects technicians have crafted a visually and thought proving fantasy that surpasses the expectations of all imaginative viewers.

the end the soft background, satiny colors, and voice of Glenda, the good witch of the north portrayed by Billie Burke represents a motherly figure who provide the wisdom that Dorothy trust in bring her back home. The vibrancy of the ruby slippers and the three clicking of the heals together might suggest that it is heart, brains, and courage that are the inherent qualities we all possess yet must use to take us home or on our life's journey. The lesson is that children both young and old often fail to recognize ""There is no place like home."" By having the open eyes to see compassion, intelligence, and demonstrating a courageous heart we all move forward to capture our dreams. The Wizard of Oz is a musical fantasy movie that provides far more than munchkins, witches, and a tornado that propels a Kansas farm setting into the Land of Oz, it's a life's lessons for children of all ages.",10/10,20 September 2015,master_mower,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
Emblazoned on the national psyche,"While some say this movie does not measure up to the masterpieces of Bulgarian cinema, the Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic, a miraculous rendering of the only authentic American fairy tale.

The script. It lives in our culture, woven into the fabric of our thoughts and conversations. ""I don't think we're in Kansas anymore."" ""Are you a good witch or a bad witch?"" ""Just click your heels three times and say, 'There's no place like home.'"" ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."" ""Surrender Dorothy."" ""I'm melting, melting!""

The music. Songs people hum every day. ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""We're off to see the wizard,"" ""Follow the yellow brick road.""

What other movie has even come close to engraving itself that way into our consciousness? (Casablanca and Gone With The Wind only have a couple quotes each that we remember, not even considering the songs.)

The stars. The best work of each actor. The cornerstone of the iconic reputation of the greatest cinematic voice ever. Judy, Judy, Judy.

There have been books written about the production of this movie, but in the end we just have to be grateful that somehow, despite multiple directors and cast changes and hair changes, it all came together in this incredible flick. It just happened.

A definite whiz of a wiz....,"Easily one of the top films of all time, this infectiously charming and meticulously crafted musical has become legendary and runs deep in the blood of anyone who saw it as a child and revisits it as an adult. Garland plays a rather restless Kansas farm girl living with her aunt and uncle and pouring her feelings out to her beloved dog Toto. The local crankpot is bound and determined to send Toto away to be destroyed for such grievous crimes as chasing her cat and running through her garden (and also snipping at her decidedly untasty leg!) Just as Garland realizes that she has to face up to her challenges and responsibilities (after briefly running away) a tornado hits and she is konked on the head. She awakens to an entirely different world (called Oz) in which great beauty is tempered by even greater evil. She finds herself at odds with the Wicked Witch of the West (Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to destroy her (and her little dog, too!) while she desperately tries to reach the title character whom she hopes will get her back to Kansas. Along the way to the Wizard of Oz, she is joined by a trio of equally needy friends. The Scarecrow requires brains, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Cowardly Lion longs for courage. Together, they brave the Witch's scare tactics and set out to achieve their personal goals. It turns out that the foursome always had the things they desired, they just never really realized it. This is a rather clinical deconstruction of what is a magical and psychologically affecting tale. The story works on many levels and contains endless parallels (driven home by the fact that many of the people in Garlands home life appear as the characters in Oz.) It's observation of human desires and needs could be dissected for hours. Beyond that, the entire film is jaw-droppingly beautiful (even the ""drab"" opening and closing sequences shot in a sepia tone.) With expert talent involved in the production (Cedric Gibbons, Adrian anyone?), it's an eye-popper throughout and an aural delight as well. The songs (with peerless tongue-twisting lyrics) approach Gilbert & Sullivan greatness at times with Garland's unforgettable rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" just one of many gems. All of the acting is top-notch. Garland's portrayal works because she completely buys into the story. She believes and so the audience believes. Her almost unfailing optimism gains greater irony when compared with her own troubled life. Bolger, Haley and Lahr forge an iconic, thoroughly enjoyable trio, each getting the chance to show off his considerable comedic and musical talent. Morgan plays virtually everyone of note in Oz and gives great presence to each characterization. Toto is one of the true great screen canines. It's impossible not to root for him as he scampers across rough terrain to find help for his owner. The real blood-curdler here, however, is Hamilton. She crafts a character so vile, so menacing and so relentlessly evil that it's hard to ponder anyone else in the role. Every gesture, every inflection of her voice seems calculated to drive kids under the covers (and has....for generations.) Someone bitter or bored, with no sense of awe, may find ways to pick at the story or the technical aspects of a film that's more than 60 years old, but most everyone will be enchanted by (and moved by) this one of a kind piece of film history.",No rating,29 January 2004,Poseidon-3,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
"""Only bad witches are ugly.""","What a curious lesson in morality that is. But then there's plenty more in this dated musical about a redneck girl's Day-Glo daydream.

With self-conscious sentimentality this film is so sanitised that a chubby Judy Garland can fall into a pigsty without being covered in a single drop of pig muck. However, it's impossible to criticise the film in modern terms  Garland's stagy, melodramatic performance was typical for the time  and the whole movie has the sense of the classic, if not actually the sense of being any good.

The picture's transformation from monochrome to Technicolor is justly praised, though the painted backdrops are a little obvious and two-dimensional. It's images seemingly inspired (and were improved by) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There the Oompa Loompas would dole out social commentary in song form; here the Munchkins chant asinine phrases. And just how irritating are the Munchkins? It's all really quite twee and forced, and despite entering the collective consciousness, songs like ""Follow The Yellow Brick Road"" are really quite annoying when heard for real. It's all very ambitious, but there's also an unsettling lack of genuine wit.

Much better are the talking trees, wicked witch and flying monkeys. All silly now of course, but absolutely terrifying to children. I still remember being scared silly at the witch being dissolved with water. There's also a scene with the Tin Man where his dance causes him to almost topple over in moves mimicked by Michael Jackson in Moonwalker. Jackson would later play the Scarecrow in the all-black version, The Wiz. That's the character without a brain. How curious.

Of course, this is definitely not one to watch with an after-Christmas hangover, the ""lions and tigers and bears"" chant being particularly grating on the senses. Brash and unremittingly childish, The Wizard of Oz is less a cinematic experience, more like spending 100 minutes being shouted at by a hyperactive toddler.",6/10,6 January 2001,The_Movie_Cat,The Wizard of Oz (1939),NEGATIVE
"VIEW IT AS AN ADULT, VISUALIZE IT AS A CHILD","I first watched ""The Wizard of Oz"" as a child. It was memorable for many reasons. The songs, the cartoon quality of the characters, and the colorful story and sets made it a life experience I remember to this day. Most vivid to me as a child of 7-8 was how scared I was of the Wicked Witch of the West. I have seen this film many times since, and have enjoyed it with my siblings and my wife and children also. It is truly one of the great films of all time. In fact, it was ahead of its time. I am surprised it is only #52 on the list of greatest American films. It is part of our DNA, as virtually every American has seen this film. Judy Garland, Ray Bulger, and Jack Haley are marvelous together, and the the supporting cast very memorable. What other movie has munchkins? The songs are very catchy, and ""Over The Rainbow"" is one of the great songs of the 20th Century. The theme of the film is to get ""home"" and the importance of helping others. In the age we live in, maybe every adult should watch ""The Wizard of Oz"" again, and watch it with the eyes of a child.

Campy fairy tale that is strangely heavy-handed.,"A whirlwind hits Kansas and carries a young girl in to a strange and mystical world.

One of those products that you feel slightly stupid reviewing, but I guess a new audience for it is born every minute. Also it a good example of a book and film that, while joined at the hip, are also very different products. The book is light, throwaway and fun while the film gets very heavy and morose almost like a horror movie. Very strange for a film aimed at children.

Judy Garland's life was one big rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and seemed to involve an unfruitful search for happiness through people, produce and drugs. How apt that her most famous film should also feature a similar journey and how sad that while reading the script she could not take on the moral: That happiness comes from within and that life is what you make of it.

Garland's talent was (and remains through film) immense. What a pair of lungs and what vocal control. A freak of nature that was plucked from nowhere, exploited and then thrown away by the studio system. She died young, but she had lived her show business life already and had no role left to play other than sing to ever dwindling gay audiences. Oz maybe a cruel place at times, but it is no more cruel than the real world it apes.

Here we have main characters that are in search of change, but they are living in a ""cast"" society in which function seems given by the state. Maybe I am thinking too literally, but how does Oz go round? Who paints the road yellow - and why? A road doesn't have to be completely painted to be followed and why brick, very expensive way to pave a road! Maybe examples of how nonsense stands out more in films.

Maybe they thought that making this a musical would make it lighter and more fun. But it doesn't really work that way. Fun song and dance is one thing, but this hardly taking away the sense of danger and threat. Wicked witches are killers (or at least potential killers) so how can they be taken lightly or in jest? What is being demonstrated is that making the written page literal goes beyond the original intent. Children are meant to be slightly scared - not petrified as they would be watch this film.

Legends have grown up around this film in production. From colour difficulty to the parties that the ""little people"" threw after filming was done for the day. I am sure most of them are myths and besides, I am sure there is partying and sex after the end of most day's filming on most films.

In the Wizard of Oz we are transported to a strange world with great performances from all the leads, especially Garland who has to carry the weight of this giant production on her shoulders. I feel for her, where else is a child (or near child) expected to carry such responsibility but in show business? I guess the only world stranger than Oz is the world of show business.

The Greatest Fantasy One Could Embark On,"In 1900, Lyman Frank Baum wrote a story about a little girl named Dorothy who was hurled away from dusty Kansas to the magnificent land of Oz, filled with talking Scarecrows, wicked witches, big headed wizards and magical shoes. This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart.

But where The Wizard of Oz truly shines is in it's moral, that there is no place like home. Stated only once in Baum's original story, this quote has been the most prominent and well known movie quote ever spewed from a human mouth and it goes to show that no matter who you are and where you are, you always have a place to go to and people you can love and cherish. It's not about what kind of home it is, it's the fact that it's a home and it's a place where you can be who you want to be and relate with those most dear to you. It's the love and the warmth of being together that really matters and it's what Dorothy realizes at the very end of the film, that no matter how sepia toned her homelike is, she can be happy there and always love the things around her. That is one of the many reasons why this film is truly perfect in every sense of the word. Nah, it's not perfect, nothing is perfect, but this film is pretty darn spectacular and it's a film that will live on many, many, many, many, many years down the road, even after I am gone off the face of the Earth. This film is a tradition that generation to generation can savor and take to the heart and it's a film no one can deny, no one can get fed up with. It's the very film that gets you out of sadness and despair and into the realm of grandiose and fantastic nature. It's the film that gives us brains, gives us courage, gives us heart, gives us strength.

That's all I have to say about that.",10/10,3 May 2013,zurnd,The Wizard of Oz (1939),POSITIVE
"Just not my type of movie, I guess.","Ok. I readily admit that Wizard of Oz is a classic. It's full of style, wonder, and originality. But I just don't like it. I didn't care much for it when I saw it as a kid, I didn't like it as an adult, and I certainly don't like it now that I've seen it 100 times thanks to my 3 year old nephew.

I don't mind musicals most of the time. One of my favorite animated films, The Prince of Egypt, is as full of songs as any similar Disney cartoon. But the songs in that film were well done in my opinion. They had sweep when they needed to be, hit emotional waves when it seemed appropriate. In the Wizard of Oz, everyone sings pretty much all the time, and it's one of those films where absurd words and terms are inserted simply to keep the rhymes going, even if the line doesn't make any sense. Imagine a Doctor Suess book being sung in chorus. Sure it rhymes, half of the words are made up. There's a good deal of that in Wizard.

And you better like ""We're off to see the Wizard"", the song you've heard since the beginning of time and already are tired of. You'll hear it in this movie about half a dozen times, without any significant changes or necessity. I know that movies like this are supposed to this way, it just drives one nuts.

The acting is typical of hammy 50s productions, just a decade older. Everyone enunciates very properly and/or hammily, and look to be on the verge of bursting into song, which often is the case. That's pretty much how it stays once Dorothy gets to Oz, which is after the boring first fifteen minutes of the film.

I know that people will seethe when they read this review. I'm sorry, I just really don't like this movie. As a musical, and a whimsical kids' movie, it succeeds at what it attempts to be. But I just can't understand why this is considered a film benchmark, when there are plenty of more interesting and less annoying musicals to be enjoyed. Granted, ""Over the Rainbow"" is a good song, and my favorite was one sung by the coroner of Oz (whose tune lasts about 4 verses). But the rest? Man...to me, it's just utter tedium. The movie may be good for kids, but I just can't understand why any adult would care to sit through it. I'm obviously in the minority, so what can I say. I just wanted to voice my opinion, which is that Wizard of Oz is vastly overrated. Read the book instead, or watch something better from the era such as Casablanca.",6/10,22 March 2004,manalone923,The Wizard of Oz (1939),NEGATIVE
It holds up,"I saw this movie again after a few decades. There are a lot of movies from past eras that don't hold up over time, but this one does. It's just as suspenseful as it was in 1975. But the best reason to watch it is Robert Shaw's performance. You hardly ever see those type of personalities in movies anymore.

"Even with very dated technology, this is a great film to watch.","Back in 1975, ""Jaws"" made a huge splash (pardon the pun) in theaters. It set all sorts of box office records and made the covers of magazines all over the country. And, the film was seen as groundbreaking and amazing.

In other words, the shark often looks very fake but the story is so good and handled so well, you really don't care.

A monster of a movie,"I re-watched this film recently and was blown away by the absolute suspense it invoked in me. My daughter (whom is 17) and I were both stunned at the quality and realism of a film made in 1975!! Our TV is 55 inches which showed the movie off to it's full potential and it certainly did not disappoint.

That iconic moment of the young lady going skinny dipping in the dark with her male friend is utterly haunting. You know the horror of what's going to happen, the buoy dinging in the background gives you the chills. Steven Spielberg captures pure terror in that scene.

Jaws completely absorbs you, as the trio of shark hunters venture off to try to snare the great white you begin to feel part of their adventure. You fear for them, get excited with them and dread what will happen next. When that fishing line starts spinning your heart starts pumping. This is pure class.

The dynamics of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw's relationship(s) work brilliantly. The differences in their characters persona's is such that they rub each other up the wrong way, disrespect one another and wind each other up but in the end they are there for each other and develop a bond that I think surprises them all.

As things begin to unravel your heart goes out to the trio and trepidation is the only way forward. They have the fight of their life on their hands, their bravery is boundless. You feel in awe of them.

"So Much More Than Just A ""Shark Movie""","Reputationally-speaking, ""Jaws"" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique ""shark-eye view"" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note ""attack"" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make ""Jaws"" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.

For a very basic overview, ""Jaws"" tells the story of the coastal town of Amity, which suddenly and inexplicably becomes the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential loss of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the giant predator.

As stated, the general premise and music here are well-known. But what always strikes me with each ""Jaws"" re-watch is how much it is a human drama as opposed to a horror piece driven by a villain (the shark, in this case).

The first half of ""Jaws"" takes place almost entirely ""on land"", if you will, and focuses more on the politics of fear and commerce than anything supernatural or scary. If there are ever any doubts as to whether that material holds up, they can easily be put to rest after viewing the film through a pandemic context. Substitute ""global contagious disease"" for ""mindless, unstoppable shark"" and it's as relevant today as ever.

The second half leans more towards ""adventure sea chase"", and is buoyed by ocean scenes that, despite being filmed 45+ years ago now, do not seen old or outdated in the least. Masterful cinematography almost always holds up, and Spielberg's behind-the-camera decisions certainly do here as well. Even then though, in the midst of a brutal and thrilling chase, Spielberg stops the action for a touching scene in which the three seaman bond over song and shared experiences.

In order to fully exhibit such depth of character, great acting is required--and given here in spades. ""Jaws"" features a collection of unique characters that are always a joy to revisit. Scheider as the ""why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!"" sheriff lets viewers relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint is singularly iconic, juxtaposing jocularity and complexity perfectly within his single character.

Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give ""Jaws"" is that every time I see it, I can't help but be swept away in all its winning aspects. Whether it be the drama, emotion, music, thrills, adventure, visuals, acting, or just overall heart of the piece, there is not a single scene wasted or underutilized. I have absolutely no doubt that it will remain just as visceral of an experience going forward as it was for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.",10/10,6 March 2017,zkonedog,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
One of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies,"I will never forget the first time I saw Jaws. I was glued to the seat from start to finish. I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz. He has never been better.

One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"Jaws (1975) **** (out of 4)

Steven Spielberg's classic about a man-eating Great White shark stalking the beaches of Amity and the three men who go out to try and kill it. Seriously, is there anyone who doesn't know the plot to this masterpiece?

Considering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it's hard to pick one thing but I'd say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.

Even though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I'm sure each viewer has met so it's easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.

The film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn't know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we're constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.

What's even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can't think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife.

For me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you're really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you're in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we've had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it's doubtful anything ever will.",No rating,24 June 2015,Michael_Elliott,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE

You might want to remain on shore for a while after this movie...,"There is no doubt about the fact that ""Jaws"" is a classic. And it is also an influential movie that helped open up for many other movies in its wake.

The story in ""Jaws"" is one that I think everyone is familiar with, even if you haven't seen the movie before. Because it is just one of those movies that everyone knows. But briefly summarized, it is the story of a massive white shark turning up in the waters of a popular beach resort and wreaks havoc on the swimmers. Sheriff Brody teams up with eccentric captain Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper to rid the waters of the deadly shark.

While this movie was released back in 1975, the year I was born as well, it still holds its ground today. Sure, some of the effects are outdated by today's standards, but other effects still prove effective and great. What makes the movie still stand its ground is not the effects, of course, it is the solid storyline and the amazing performances by the cast.

""Jaws"" have some really impressive and very memorable performances by Roy Scheider (playing Brody), Robert Shaw (playing Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (playing Matt Hooper). Furthermore, there are also some good supporting appearances from Lorraine Gary (playing Ellen Brody) and Murray Hamilton (playing Mayor Larry Vaughn).

It is the intense storyline of the movie that makes the movie watchable over and over again, and I don't have count of how many times I have actually watched ""Jaws"" throughout the years. And this is also what makes it a classic, because the movie is timeless.

Furthermore, the movie also has an impressive soundtrack. And everyone knows the theme music to ""Jaws"", even people who might not have watched the movie.

""Jaws"" is definitely a movie that has withstood the test of time, and it is a movie that future generations will enjoy as well, just as us who grew up watching this movie (and its sequels).",7/10,28 April 2017,paul_haakonsen,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
JAWS = Timeless Cinema,"It's true, few movies tell a story better and in a more compelling way than JAWS - the original summer blockbuster, which was a world-wide smash-hit or ""phenomenon"" upon it's initial release in May of 1975. Forty-one years later it still stands as one of the best movies of all time and having seen it well over 100 times in the past 30 years, I can firmly attest to it's extreme longevity and at this point it would seem JAWS' ability to entertain me, myself and the masses is indefatigable. In other words: JAWS IS ETERNAL. An ageless, universally beloved masterpiece and due to the films great originality, it has always been easy for me to admire it.

The films great cast of Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Grey and Murray Hamilton really pull together here and throughout the film they play off each other beautifully, the cast exudes a type of ""naturalistic chemistry"" that's rarely attained in movies. That's one of the key reasons why JAWS is such a cohesive and enduring movie and if you haven't noticed over the years, all of the scenes in this movie gel perfectly, with not a single scene being wasted or without purpose. Deftly directed by a 27 year-old Steven Spielberg throughout the course of mid 1974 to early 1975, the production was a troubled one (primarily due to malfunctioning mechanical sharks) and the budget ballooned to several times it's original estimate, but as the film resoundingly shows they succeeded in creating a gripping masterpiece of cinema - that's often mimicked in one way or another, but has certainly never been bettered.

Set in the fictitious locale of Amity Island (as most know, in actuality it was filmed in and around Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts) JAWS tells the story of a once-pleasant sea-side community, that suddenly finds itself being terrorized, by a huge Great White shark ""That's a 20-footer... 25, 3-tons of em'"" that's gone -rogue- and has staked a claim off the beaches of Amity Island. Naturally this causes confusion and commotion among the town folk, bounties are set, amateur shark-hunters recklessly take to the water and throughout the bloody-tension-filled affair, the towns various entities of local government are constantly clashing with each other; in other words lots of friction and stubborn, thick-headed resistance bubble up and the tension is at times so thick, you can cut it with a knife. Basically what it is, is enough people have to be eaten by the shark, before the mayor and his circle of cronies finally pull their heads out of the sand and come to the same obvious conclusion - that Martin Brody, the sharp-witted and instinctual sheriff had already concluded. So add governmental haranguing as yet another element weaved into this intricate, yet cohesive story.

The film is bi-sected into two distinctly different acts, with the first half taking place mostly on the dry ground of Amity Island, with a few boating and swimming excursions, but still largely land-based. However, in the second half, we find ourselves adrift at sea aboard Quint's boat, for the remainder of the movie - which most would agree is the more exciting part. The role of the shark-hunter ""Quint"" is BRILLIANTLY played by the late-great Robert Shaw and is, by far, the films most-memorable and most-colorful character. Rarely is a film character so vividly well put together and as memorable as the cantankerous Quint, with his voice being the key reason; plus he has some mighty colorful ""fisherman's tales"" to tell, as you will find out. You can thank the numerous other ""bigger names"" that, for varying reasons, turned down that role of which there were several, with Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum being just a couple of them. The action and excitement are all cranked up several notches in the latter half of the film, with much tension between the three ship mates, Brody, Matt Hooper (a marine biologist) and the ever-salty Quint. This iconic film concludes with what's literally ""Smile you son-of-a!"" an explosive finale! That which has long stood as one of cinema's most memorable, if not improbable, endings.

The Music: As Steven Spielberg has said, the music of John Williams is half the movie and it easily ranks as one of the most memorable and effective film scores of all-time. A powerful and ingenious orchestral score, dripping with gloomy atmosphere and with much in the way of toothy serrated menace and of course JAWS has what's probably the best-known movie theme ever written. Williams' award-winning music for JAWS not only took his career to the next level, but in a very big way helped resuscitate a dying art-form; that of course being large-scale orchestral film scores, which had been in steady decline since the mid to late 1960's. Williams' score for Star Wars just two years later would yet further benefit that cause to even greater effect.

On The Oscar Front: JAWS took home three Oscar's (for, best sound recording, best score and best film editing) and damn well should of had another or two, Best Picture being one of them.

Ultimately JAWS stands as a grand and regal film classic - that only an idiot (or a heretic) would not like.

......and yes, because of this movie and it's infinitely lesser sequels, I shudder at the mere thought of being in the ocean.

**Update**: The wreck site of Quint's ship the U.S.S. Indianapolis was discovered on August 19th 2017, by a deep-sea search team lead by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen 72 years after her infamous sinking. Her watery grave rests some 18,000 feet below the surface of the Philippine Sea.

Thanks Paul, it's been a long time coming.

Suspenseful and Iconic,"Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense. Why was the film so successful? What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70's & why are we still talking about it in 2016? To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts. Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each other's eyes. Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach. The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen. This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays. Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark. In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have. In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock. We're following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way. Close ups of people's faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film. They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock. Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment. Shock is found in the close up of the woman's face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water. Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself. In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot. A quick zoom occurs on Brody's face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch. Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen.

Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film. As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well. Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes. You're never shown everything. Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature. These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from. The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind. You don't see the attacker but you know they are there. When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa).

The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water. The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film. Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects. The viewer doesn't need to see the shark to know it is there. When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen. There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brody's reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition. It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining. The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.",7/10,16 March 2016,julie-siegrist,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
"An Absolute Must See, This Is How To Make A Movie!","Jaws

I watched this on My Home cinema on a big screen and it really needs to be seen this way I can't say how much I enjoyed it, it really was a revelation re-visiting this classic.

Just about everything was in place the acting was just incredible between Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus, it was a masterclass in acting it really was.

The score was unbelievable and the iconic programmatic theme with the piano notes and strings at the bottom just embodied an imagined creeping threat. I could hear bits of Westside Story as well as any Bernard Herrmann as an influence it was masterful!

I'd forgotten how much of the movie was about politics and a small town and the threat to its livelihood from a man eating shark, the fashions were also great as was the styling.

But the key fantastic thing is the way the camera moved, moving in at the right moment on a characters face moving back to show the panorama and actually making believable a large rubber shark it was absolutely amazing.

Overall I'm giving this a 10 out of 10 it would be churlish of me to deduct a point for some of the scenes where the shark looked less than believable but hey ho for entertainment value alone it's a 10.",10/10,21 January 2022,martimusross,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Changed Cinema For the Better,"I don't think its any argument that this can go down as one of the most influential films of all time as it set Hollywood on a road filled with blockbusters. At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems. There isn't much character development and the movie relies heavily on its shark attacks to keep the movie moving forward. But there isn't much arguing the movie's overall significance in the history of cinema.

The first few scenes are quite a thrill even with it being almost 40 years later. Once you see the blood cover the water it instantly sends chills down your body. It takes a while for Richard Dreyfuss to get to the screen, who is by far the best part of the movie. But I would still say that the 3 men who are chosen to kill the shark aren't that interesting. But in terms of the look of the shark, I was stunned at how real it appears to be. There are some movies made now that have worse effects than this. It also amazed me at how dumb the people in this movie can be. The people on the beach are ALL aware of the recent shark attacks but yet they still feel they need to swim in the ocean. It reminds me of the citizens of New York during the Spider-Man movies. People in the world aren't that dumb.

I was also taken back by the idea to break their only communication to the world on the boat. I still don't know why they destroyed it with a random baseball bat? Why is that on a boat? Nevertheless the movie did a lot for cinema and cemented its impact on special effects used.

+big impact on cinema today

+Richard Dreyfuss

-dumb citizens and unrealistic choices

"Boring, Unscientific, & Has Aged Poorly","First, this movie is stupid in so far as it is filled with anti-shark propaganda. You have a much greater chance of being killed by a falling coconut or a dog than a shark. They are not a force of evil created by Satan.

The movie could still have been entertaining however, lots of good movies have idiotic stories. Unfortunately, the characters are dull, the story moves at a snail pace, the serious dialogue laughable, the shark fake looking, and the acting mediocre. Really, the only things worthwhile are the poster and the shark theme.

Tldnr: a boring curio from the 70s that probably helped push the great white further towards extinction.

The Epitome of Suspense,"No movie can beat the brilliance of ""Jaws"" within the world of suspense and horror. Some movies have come close, others have even matched it and gone on as legends themselves. But none have, or ever will, surpass this Spielberg masterpiece.

Everything about this movie is flawless. It's most famous for its editing and direction. There is nothing to nit-pick. Just go see it, and I will withhold judgement if for some reason you dislike it in any way.

For those who are big fans of Jaws, and have not yet seen the movie that launched Spielberg's career, go watch it, it's called ""Duel.""

The masterclass of suspense.,"Steven Spielberg will forever be linked with some of the greatest movies on all time, everyone knows Jaws, and everyone will recognise the iconic music. Superior to the mostly disappointing follow ups that came, nothing quite matched this.

Jaws shows the power of film, a film that changed people's perceptions of white sharks for decades, fortunately people have a much better understanding of the majestic apex predators these days.

Action packed, fast moving, it's the threat of what's lurking beneath that makes this such a thrill ride, with a land predator you can see it, with a shark, you have no idea where it's going to spring from.

Iconic lines throughout, it's not without a touch of humour.

Modern filmmakers need to take cues from Jaws,"Watching Jaws today, the film has just as much impact as it did back in 1975. Why? Because, rather than relying on special effects, the film relies on characters, dialogue and atmosphere. The shark's presence is always felt, even though it is rarely seen. However, what you remember most from this film are the characters. The interaction on the boat between the three leads is cinema perfection. The filmmakers of today have lost their way in a sea of weightless CGI and meaningless noise. A true masterpiece ""monster movie"" begins with good characters and atmosphere, the effects are merely the icing on the cake.

A masterful classic that still lives up to this day!,"The first summer blockbuster, the big breakthrough for Spielberg, and the shoot that ended up tripling its schedule! Jaws is a monster of a film that changed not only the moviemaking world but also the beach-goer's confidence. It is as though we are born with the knowledge of this movie. As a very young child I genuinely believed the Jaws 'Dun...Dun' always played before a real life shark attack was about to take place, I hadn't even seen the film! Something said constantly about this movie is that the terror comes from not showing the shark but from simply suggesting it. Where and when is the shark going to pop up next? This was an idea that Spielberg developed mostly due to the issues with the repeatedly breaking mechanical shark but taken also from the master of suspense himself, Hitchcock. ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it"".

An important aspect of Jaws is that it shows the audience reasons to care for the characters rather than telling them to care. ""Give me a kiss"", ""why?"", ""cause I need it"". Chief Brody's (Roy Scheider) vulnerable side is very evident and so he is a man we can have sympathy for, we care about his family and so we care about him.

The film is also very aware of what it is doing to its audiences. Brody is transfixed looking at a picture-book about sharks; he can't believe what he's seeing. Though he jumps out of his skin when his wife (Lorraine Gary) comes up behind him. We saw this coming so it was not a shock for us but it is a joke on the film itself. It is almost a cliche today but It's one of those friendly nods to the audience letting us know our director is conscious of what we're going through together.

The hunt to get the shark doesn't actually start until over midway through the film. The film doesn't simply delay the hunt of the shark, it builds towards it. No one would argue that the first half of the film is slow or uneventful. A testament to the writer's brilliance of structure and timing, knowing when to unleash the beast.

This is Spielberg's first film where he establishes his trademark of guiding our eye throughout each scene without drawing attention to the craft. He captures multiple angles in one take to help keep a flow to the story and an intrigue in what the characters are saying to each other. Never allowing a moment to become boring. You feel like you are in the scene with the characters. The second that you notice the way he moves the camera or blocks the scene is the moment you fall out of the movie and become a viewer. We are just as helpless as Chief Brody as we watch Alex Kintner be torn apart from afar, a point of view from Brody's powerless position.

Finally, it is Brody who kills the shark, not Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) nor Quint (Robert Shaw). It is the protagonist who we have watched struggle for almost 2 hours with a beach full of people, a thoughtless mayor, and a 25-foot great white shark, 3 tons of him! It is a satisfying end. Brody kills the shark by himself while the mast of the boat sinks into the ocean like a clock hand ticking to its conclusion. Soon there will be nothing left on the surface as though the shark has consumed the film itself, but one perfect shot put a stop to that.

Overall, a masterful classic that still lives up to this day. Even most of the mechanical shark shots still remain stunning and sometimes horrific. The film stays away from fantasy and sticks itself in reality which is why so many become afraid of the sea after this experience. I would have loved to discuss the making-of process more but for any Jaws fans or anyone who is interested then I would suggest you read The Jaws Log, written by one of the screenwriters for Jaws, Carl Gottlieb.

One of the Greatest Thrillers Ever Made,"'Jaws' is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.

Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.

Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.

Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure.

Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.

'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.

That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.

The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.

'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.",No rating,23 July 2004,eht5y,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
It got less interesting when they started to hunt for the shark,"The first hour of the movie was good and I was intrigued with the plot, but I became less interested when they started to hunt the shark because I felt like it became less thrilling and the tone of the movie changed. On a positive note I thought the action scenes were good and they definitely looked realistic, and I also liked the characters who I thought they were portrayed well.

An Appreciation of Robert Shaw,"Okay, it's been 36 years now since that summer when we were all afraid to go into the water, and what was new and suspenseful and amazing then is either a milestone or a cliché, depending on who you listen to.

I don't want to review the whole movie, because I don't think anyone needs a review of the whole movie. I just want to talk about one particular scene in the movie that, for me, lifted it above ordinary thriller material and put me in awe of what an actor can do.

That's the scene when Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are on the boat ""Orca,"" and they're all sitting around a table in the galley and they're slightly drunk. They start comparing scars, and Dreyfuss or Scheider, can't remember which, notices the tattoo that Shaw has. The one with the name ""USS Indianapolis"".

When Shaw describes what happened to the men on the Indianapolis, what it was like, in that one scene, he makes the character of Sam Quint real, and completely understandable. Shaw makes the whole movie live and breath and crystalize in that one scene.

I didn't get to see many movies when I was growing up, and when I went away to college I didn't have time or money to go to the movies. I didn't actually get to see Jaws when it first came out. But when I had time to see movies and could actually watch them on the VCR, this scene in ""Jaws"" was the first that actually left me in awe of what an actor could do, if he was good enough. If the material was good enough.

After the movie was over, I couldn't wait to hunt up information on the USS Indianapolis and the events Shaw described. This wasn't as easy back then, around 1980, as it is now: there was no internet, so if you wanted to research something, you had to go to the library and try to find a book or magazine or archival newspaper stories. Well, I found a book about the Indianapolis and I was fascinated.

I was awe-struck at the power Robert Shaw had to evoke the tragedy of the Indianapolis in that one scene. For me, that one scene made the whole movie. Shaw made me understand the character he played, and got through to make me feel the primal fear a shark can evoke.

That's a powerful talent. And Shaw certainly was a powerful talent; I loved him in ""The Sting"" and in ""A Man for All Seasons."" But I think I saw him truly at his best in those magical moments of that one scene in ""Jaws,"" when through his talent he broke through the gloss of fanciful entertainment and got right to the heart of terror, and in so doing lifted a summer suspense thriller above the ordinary into the extraordinary. I am thankful for Shaw and his art.

Jaws,"A man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.

Jaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practise's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.

But is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office {world wide} and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.

Jaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg {learning from Hitchcock for sure} tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building {by way of Brody's family arc} sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims remains are found Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much that we are about to be witness to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man, and then the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.

So many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the dread unfolding. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, casting aside technical problems {and genuine resentment at times} to portray this story with verve and genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider {Brody}, Robert Shaw {Quint} and Richard Dreyfuss {Hooper} were from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper, whilst Jaws author {and co screen writer here} Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!

Still it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type to have ever been made. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body, file it along side King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Masterpieces, 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.",10/10,12 June 2008,hitchcockthelegend,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
"How good acting, editing, directing and music can overcome a silly script","It's a testament to Spielberg's talent that he could make a movie like Jaws into a revered classic. The plot is incredible silly. You have a ocean full of perfectly edible creatures. Yet the SUPER shark only munches on people from one particular beach in New England. Yeah,un-huh, sure.But guess what, it works. Spielberg wisely builds up the suspense. We know the shark is out there and hungry. Yet we have to use our imagination on just how scary the shark is. So the tension and suspence builds and builds as the movie progresses. The New England setting works effectively. The extras all look and act like normal people. Giving the movie a sense of believability that say a Flordia beach setting would lack. The acting is wonderful. Shaw,Scneider and Dreyfuss throw themselves completely into their roles. Even if the characters are rather one dimensional. You can almost feel their fear at the climax. John Williams music is tight, but effective. Usually when Williams scores a movie he practically has music for every scene. (Which most of the time is a good thing) But keeping it to a minimum it's builds the suspence. Recommend if nothing else so many cliches stem from this movie's success. That and Kevin Smith references it in almost all his films.",6/10,29 October 2001,hippiegal,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
It's A Kid's Movie,"The film has its moments of tension, like when Brody (Roy Scheider) feeds fish into the ocean and, as he is chatting, quite unexpectedly the head of a giant shark pops up out of the water next to him. ""You're going to need a bigger boat"", Brody then ominously warns Quint (Robert Shaw), skipper of the rickety old fishing boat they're in. This sequence shows up in the second half, where most of the film's tension is. And the cinematography in this second half is quite good.

But overall ""Jaws"" is a silly, made-for-kids adventure that is not remotely plausible. The shark keeps coming back to the crew's boat, as if the shark is out for revenge. Referring to the shark, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the third of three crew members, says: ""he's chasing us; I don't believe it."" No, I don't believe it either. Natural predators are not capable of revenge.

Of course, to advance the plot and keep the audience engaged, the unlikable and stupid three-man crew does all the wrong things. On-board chaos results. But the film's shallow (pardon the pun) premise and plot sells the popcorn, no ""deep"" themes needed.

The story setup is way too long. Lots of talky dialogue, crowds of beached whales (or rather sunbathers), a parade, and a greedy mayor who is more of a villain than the shark render a boring first half. Director Spielberg could have used the shark to chop off most of the script's first half.

""Jaws"" is a big budget Hollywood production with some tension out on the open waters. And it has some good underwater footage. But a too simplistic premise, precious little subtext, vapid setup, and unlikable, overwrought characters sink the film into the dregs, the production appeal veering sharply toward viewers pacified by frothy, Disney-ish cheese.",3/10,11 May 2012,Lechuguilla,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
One of the best,"Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. Start to finish- it's near impossible to find fault in this movie. Peak Spielberg, directing a perfectly written script, perfectly acted by a talented cast with almost impenetrably good special effects captured flawlessly by the cinematographer and crew. That's without even considering John Williams' amazing soundtrack. A nearly perfect film. It starts, happens, and ends without the viewer even being aware that it's happening. And then you realize that that you just watched a timeless classic of a film that I'm confident will endure as long as people are sane because of it's overall quality. There are literally no faults with this movie. A top 5 all time for me.

"If this movie scares you to the point where you can't go back into the water, then Spielberg has done job well done","Jaws is a movie the I grew up with, it's like the first real horror film I ever watched. What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.

Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.

Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.

This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the ""Indianapolis"" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!"" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church!

One Of The Best Films Ever!,"I wasn't alive when this film first was released. I wasn't there to witness the hysteria that followed in its wake. By the time, I was born it was already well-established in Western culture (and had spawned three atrocious sequels). Only films like Star Wars can match this movie for sheer cultural impact. Even today, over thirty years after it's original release, when people think of sharks, they think of Jaws.

Perhaps much of this owes to its realistic fright factor. Jaws reached people in a way very few films have because it seemed oh-so-plausible and, more importantly, it made people wonder 'Could that happen to me?'.

But let's look past the social impact of Jaws and at the film itself as a piece of entertainment/art.

I sat down and watched Jaws the other day. I didn't mean to. Somebody else was watching it, I came in and decided to sit down and watch a few minutes. I stayed for the rest of the film, loving every minute. That quality- that watchability (if that is a word)- is one of the things that make Jaws great and helps it to stand out even from its illustrious brethren in the IMDb top 250.

Some films, like Jaws, are fantastic. However, not all fantastic films are instantly and consistently watchable like Jaws. For example, Shawshank Redemption is a top movie but its not the sort of film you can sit down and watch at any time. Jaws is a top movie and you can sit down, watch it from start to finish and enjoy yourself no matter how many times you've seen it before.

What specifically makes Jaws good then? First off, the story- a small island community heavily reliant on the tourist trade finds itself menaced by a man-eating shark. Simple but effective.

The main character, Sheriff Brody (superbly played by Roy Schneider), is tasked with managing this crisis. However, he is continually hindered in his efforts by the Mayor (and other locals) who are adamant the rising body count should be no impediment to the summer trade that is their lifeblood.

Eventually, Brody calls in marine biologist Matt Hooper (another great performance, this time by Richard Dreyfuss) who helps him convince the Mayor (with the help of the growing number of dead) that there is a real danger to the island in the form of a great white shark. In a bid to end Jaws' reign of terror, they hire grizzled shark hunter/fisherman Quint- a brilliant character brilliantly portrayed by, in my opinion, the standout star of this film, Robert Shaw- and together, the three go off to hunt for the eponymous villain.

This triad of superb characters played by sublime actors is key to Jaws' triumph as a movie. The second half of the movie is simply these three men in a boat but with their chemistry (admittedly aided by a very strong script and good direction) who needs breathtaking scenery, romance, mind-blowing special effects (though I have no qualms with what is essentially a prop, I know people think the shark looks crap) and the like? I think the proof of the pudding- and perhaps one of my favourite scenes in all of cinematic history- is the scene where the three heroes are comparing scars. I have two reasons for saying this.

One, it shows the growing bond of respect between the two seamen in Quint and Hooper who, despite their differing methods and upbringings, find common ground and good laughs in the wounds they have suffered in their travels. At the same time, poor old landlubber and mild mannered Brody only has his appendix scar to reflect on- which is masterfully shown in a subtle piece of acting/directing.

Two, I think that Quint's 'Indiannapolis' speech is the best I have ever seen. Robert Shaw's impeccable delivery (plus the reaction of his allies)and the script itself help make this moment my favourite in the entire film. It's worth buying the DVD for this scene alone- believe me.

I've eaten up a lot of words with my worship of the characters and that particular scene but don't go thinking that's all there is to this film. There are other great elements- there's plenty of action, adventure and thrills and spills. The only thing that's missing is a needlessly tacked on romance- yay! As for themes and messages, Jaws has plenty of them too. You have man's struggle against nature, the value of money over life, Quint's Ahab-esquire obsession with gaining revenge for his fallen comrades and even the 'ever present in every Spielberg film' sub-story involving fatherhood.

As you may have guessed, I can't rate this film highly enough. If you've never seen it, you are missing out. Pure gold- 10/10.

The first major summer blockbuster film,"Jaws is very much a spiritual child of Moby Dick, with a Great White Shark inserted in place of a giant white whale.

The hunting of the shark means something different for each of the three main male leads. For Brody, killing the shark would mean ensuring the safety of his children (the relationship between parents and their children being a strong running theme in nearly all of Spielberg's films). For Hooper, the shark is just another shark. It's his job to study them and provide his expertise. That's it. Then there's Quint, a Captain Ahab like figure whose obsession places him in a fit of blind fury. To him, all sharks are the same and killing this one would operate as ultimate revenge.

And like Moby Dick, Jaws is a perfectly told straightforward story depicting believable human beings and observing human behavior. Part of the joy of Jaws is watching these characters interact with each other in ways that make them seem truly alive and real, which only serves to make the threat of the shark even more threatening. We also have the land scenes of the first half that expose the stakes at the same time as it depicts the conflict between Brody and the mayor who wants to keep the beach open.

And of course, the film is marvelously constructed by Spielberg. Much is made of the way he directs the scenes of suspense, but there's also very intelligent decisions being made in non-action scenes. Many shots burned into my eyes are something as simple as a quiet moment between a father and his son who is innocently ignorant of the danger at hand.",8/10,29 October 2023,AlsExGal,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
"""You yell barracuda, everybody says, 'Hunh, what?' You yell shark, and we got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.""","This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.",No rating,14 August 1998,TacoBilly,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Horror movie classic,"Obvious one, but I like Jaws for that idea of man being subjected to the natural world, done so intensely. Humans are so arrogant, then they go up against nature and they get what comes up. I was still a little kid in grade school when I first saw Jaws. It frightened so many people off from swimming, no one I knew would go out to the deep water anymore after seeing it. It left such a psychic residue. It scares you by making you hyper-sensitive to a situation you took for granted before. Some people I know would still freak out if I even mention this subject as we enter the water. Apparently though Jaws is not one of his works Spielberg is all that fond of or proud of.

A Classic,"""Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed...""

If you don't like Jaws at 20... you have no heart.

If you don't like Jaws at 30... you have no brain.

Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss take an otherwise textbook horror film and turn it into a legendary cinematic experience.

Don't ever underestimate what great acting can accomplish.

Yes, it had a decent script and a future legendary director calling the shots - but the heart and soul of this film are the actors involved.

Hamilton and Gary also nail their roles.

Not for swimmers,"This was the film that shot Spielberg to fame. A sleepy seaside resort Amity Island has an unwanted visitor for the summer season. Conscious of the fact that the island needs visitors for the economy they try to ignore the evidence of the man eating shark and go on as normal.

The three leads Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss are excellently cast and put in fine performances. It's a bit surprising that Shaw in particular did not even get nominated for the best supporting actor award. It's a true tribute to Spielberg's craft that the head scene is still frightening even though you know what's coming.

Perfection,"Want to see a perfect movie ? Well here it is. Perfect casting, perfect pacing, great plot, right amount of humor, wonderful dialogue, and just about the best if not the best movie ever put on film. I loved it the first tine I saw it at the theater in 1975 and I still love it today. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and especially Robert Shaw are perfectly cast - cannot think of any other actors that may have been better, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton were great too. There is not a minute of wasted time in this movie - all scenes are top shelf. The only other movies in my opinion I would call perfect are Deliverance and The Thing 1982. There are a lot of great movies I love besides these 3 but they all have at least one thing in them I'd change - Not Jaws.

So the old girl is finally 30!,"Even after 30 years this is still good. the bloody scenes and effects, the scares that you KNOW are coming, the rubbery shark. Roy scheider as chief Brody going on to to be in Blue Thunder, Richard Dreyfuss going on to be in Mr Holland's opus and close encounters (or had he already been in that?) and Robert shaw (he of the Rank - gong banging fame).

They definitely needed a bigger boat, and a saner captain. the shark is most likely the biggest star. lines like needing that bigger boat, asking that son of a b*t*h to smile. the singing in the boat at night to break up the tension.

how would this be made today? seeing the shark more and earlier in the film no doubt, a cgi shark and more violent attacks i think. but this is un-re-makable!

Never Gets Old,"Talk about a movie! I will always love this film no matter how much time passes. No one has been able to make a better shark movie since Jaws. The death scenes still give me chills as you can imagine a shark ripping a person apart. The suspense is kept up perfectly throughout the entire film as you encourage Brody to find away to kill this shark attacking people. I loved the way the movie was filmed, with great acting and good lines it turned it into a masterpiece. The only downfall in the entire movie is how they drag out the end, but still worth the watch!

Spielberg's original blockbuster,"On the fictional New England resort island of Amity tourism is the main industry and each summer the beaches are backed with people hoping to swim in its beautiful waters the last thing the authorities want is news that a shark has killed somebody. When I girl disappears at sea it is first assumed she just drowned but when her body is found the Island's new Police Chief, Martin Brody, wants to close the beaches but the mayor is determined to keep them open and pressures the local doctor to certify that she was killed by a boat a second death, just off a crowded beach, causes a major panic and the mother of the victim offers a three thousand dollar reward to whoever catches the shark. This attracts everybody with a boat but doesn't impress local fisherman Quint, who demands $10,000, or shark expert Matt Hooper, who Brody invited to the island. After further deaths Brody, Quint and Hooper set of in Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt down the great white shark that has been terrorising the island. Once they find the shark it becomes clear that catching it will not be easy.

This iconic film has certainly stood the test of time and is as gripping as ever. The story is relatively simple without any real twists and that is one of its strengths. It is very much a film of two halves; the first land based as Brody tries to get the town authorities to take the shark seriously and the second out at sea as Brody, Quint and Hooper hunt down the shark. These three, brilliantly played by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss respectively, are great characters and the scenes between then on the boat are a delight; sometimes tense, sometimes funny and, when Quint tells the story of what happened when the USS Indianapolis was sunk positively chilling. The shark effects are pretty impressive, only in the final scenes does in took a bit rubbery; of course it helps that we aren't shown too much of the shark early on. The music, by John Williams, is great not just the famous 'shark theme' but also the other music. There are plenty of scary moments throughout the film; some at least as frightening as horror films largely because of its familiar setting and the fact that even though shark attacks are rare we all know that they do occasionally happen. Overall this is a great film that can be enjoyed by most people if you don't mind a few scares. It is a must see for anybody who enjoys classic movies.

The true horror is that this film is considered an 8/10,"Jaws, one of the greatest films of all time is an 8/10 on this app... disgusting. This is far more than a shark film, this movie revolutionised cinema in so many ways. Jaws masterfully creates suspense with the iconic soundtrack and the shark barely visible to us by only showing it's fun as it swims after it's next victim. This film is the best directorial debut in cinematic history and one of, if not Spielbergs greatest films. Jaws set a bar that could only be reached by few in cinema, with it being a 10/10 in nearly every category, the horror of a creature that exists in our real world that went out of its way to eat human meat over any other food source frightened the world in 1975, people even avoiding the water after viewing the film shows how great it truly is definitely a 10/10.

The Ultimate Popcorn Movie,"""Jaws"" is a thrill-ride of suspense that continues to deliver the goods to the audience 25 years later. The plot is somewhat thin: a large shark is terrorizing the tourists at the local beach. However, with that said Steven Spielberg's direction is amazing. The young director (only 28 at the time) showed unlimited potential that would only increase with age. A great accomplishment that could have been a multi-million dollar bust. 5 stars out of 5.

"All this machine does is eat, sleep and make baby sharks.","A great white shark terrorises a small community during the summer holidays, peak time for the local tourist industry.

One of the best films ever made, the originality and impact of this movie astounds me to this day. It's a movie you catch watch again and again without it become tiresome. To have been there for the original cinema release must have been quite something.

For anyone with a fear of open water, such as me, you will not want to even dip a toe in the sea ever again. It is however so much more then just a scare fest that vilifies Sharks, the characters are excellent, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are wonderful, both giving incredibly memorable performances.

The film is genuinely iconic in so many ways, several scenes will never be forgotten,that moment where the camera pans around Schneider after the Shark attacks on the beach, revolutionary, 'we're going to need a bigger boat,' another, there are so many you could choose.

What classic horror doesn't have the accompanying music, so if course it's brilliant, it is arguably the most famous ever created for a film, who doesn't know the Jaws theme, it instantly gives you chills.

The shark itself is very well imagined, they create the terror without showing you too much, had there been a rubbish plastic shark throughout (as the later films did) it wouldn't have worked so well.

This film stands the test of time, a scary, unsettling thriller, a film that probably stopped some going into the water.

An outstanding film.

An Eye For Profit,"Spielberg didn't get to be so successful by being bad...nobody does. But he did achieve success by deriving all of his imagery from even lesser sources and convincing audiences they were seeing something new. The lower the overhead cost, the greater the net profit, and this is where he first raked it in.

There's nothing complex here. He simply uses the eye of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", and gives Amity and its birdbrain inhabitants the mechanics and IQ of so many 50s monster flicks.

This is relatively good compared to the rest of his catalog, because the narrative is held together by someone else - here, the writer - who simply usurps the ""Moby Dick"" story...right down to the ""Farewell and adieu...""...Shaw's Quint as Ahab.

The absurdity works because of the Williams score which is straight out of the ""Psycho"" playbook; also the rubber shark (""Bruce"") was uncooperative half of the time; it surely saved this by forcing Spielberg to show less of the creature. He had to tighten the tension in other ways.

Although this is cheap and simple, that's what makes it ideal for commercial consumption. Just don't call it art - that began and pretty much ended with ""Duel"".",6/10,3 July 2006,jldmp1,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
A cinematic achievement.,"I know what some of you may think, the shark looks fake, sure it does, but put yourself into the shoes of a movie-goer in the summer of 1975.

Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, not because of it's technical achievement at the time being, but because how Steven Spielberg, frankly took a far-fetched idea and made it scary.

Jaws has a simple story of a twenty-five foot great white shark terrorizing civilians of Amity Island. Eventually, the town's chief of police(Roy Scheider), a marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman(Robert Shaw) are tasked to taking down the shark.

The film was known for have technical difficulties with the animatronic shark, but that was a blessing in disguise. Because of this, Spielberg manages to create tension and fear among the audience because you don't see the shark at all. Leaving your imagination to do all the work. The opening scene is downright terrifying hearing the woman screaming in agony, being dragged around by a shark we cannot see. Also the use of barrels was a stroke of genus by Spielberg and his team as it implied that the shark was near or present.

What really makes this film work are the three leads. They share an impeccable chemistry between each other. Brody is a paranoid police chief, effectively portrayed by the great Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as the wisecracking marine biologist Matt Hooper, who frequently butt heads with the rough and tough fisherman Quint, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Shaw. The three leads make these character believable and so the audience can go on a real journey with them.

I cannot see this film without Steven Spielberg. In the end he put all this together, with no script, no crew, technical malfunctions, and scrutiny. How Spielberg managed to pull this movie off under massive pressure is beyond me. It's a testament on how great he is. Give credit to the writers Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, and uncredited writer Howard Sackler for providing the film's story and sharp dialog.

Who can also forget the incredible score by John Williams. Outstanding.

Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, and the start of the blockbuster trend.

"Guess what, folks? I wasn't impressed!","Yes. The special effects, acting, and script were all well done. But perhaps the key to any great suspense film is the pacing. And this particular ""great"" suspense film, was slow to a crawl. It should have picked up, but it didn't. In fact it got SLOWER after they got onto the boat! I was waiting for a lot of action scenes with the shark. Instead I got Robert Shaw musing on his experiences as a hunter. It wasn't a thriller so much as a meditation on the potential danger of a shark, and of trying to catch one. Having started my Spielberg experiences with ET, I was used to a standard for his films that this one didn't meet. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to take a more pre-Star Wars perspective. But I couldn't. Sorry all.

Great characterization but predictable story.,"If ""Jaws"" succeeds at anything, it's in making the viewer really start to question what's in the water with them. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that wouldn't give this movie some thought before ever heading into the ocean again. This story is essentially a man versus nature tale, and serves as a reminder that although we are the most intelligent species on the planet, there are forces of nature bigger than we are.

""Jaws"" succeeds in establishing a dynamic group of characters whose interactions with one another are interesting to watch. The war veteran turned fisherman gets his rocks off by teasing the intellectual scientist, the chief just tries to keep peace to save his community...the dynamics of the relationships were interesting enough. Where I feel ""Jaws"" fails is in the story department, because although we have some interesting multi-faceted characters, the plot is still that of a B-movie. The story of a shark terrorizing a coastal community could easily have been a Roger Corman production. Spielberg manages to elevate the material to A-level status with his use of great actors and a script that fleshes the characters out more than any B-movie would attempt, and his direction produces some genuine moments of suspense, but it's predictable fare. There are few surprises for the viewer, and anyone that believes the movie will end with the shark still alive hasn't seen enough Hollywood films.

I commend Spielberg for making entire generations afraid to go into the water. But nevertheless let's not forget this is a popcorn film, elevated slightly by a good set of characters.",5/10,6 May 2010,theendisnear1985,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
"This shark, swallow you whole...","A hungry great white shark decides to camp out near an island beach community and snack repeatedly on the unsuspecting populace. Only the police chief, an oceanographer and an unstable fisherman can stop it together.

The most terrifying movie of all time. Growing up in a similar beachside community, I was convinced it was only a matter of time before I was gobbled up by a shark. That primeval fear has never really gone away. Repeated viewings over the years don't really help much. Sure, I still went swimming, but that fear was always swimming in the back of my mind...

Contains the single greatest jump scare of all time, you know which one I mean!

Perfectly cast, right down to the locals playing the locals. Robert Shaw in particular has created one of cinema's most fascinating characters. His USS Indianapolis speech is so hypnotic, it lures you inside this story to the point that you forget you're watching a movie almost. That's the power of The Spielberg, baby!

John Williams' score is otherworldly and so perfect. It's become a part of the fabric of our mutual pop culture. Pure genius.

I could rave on and on, but this movie is so huge that the whole world knows it by now and have already written about it in far better ways than I could. My absolute favorite movie of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this and see It!",10/10,23 June 2019,Lebowskidoo,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
The film that terrified you of even going in a swimming pool,"Watching this film as a 80s kid terrified me ever more of the sea ( even though I love to snorkel now my heart still races and I look around in fear 😅) my mum had the book which is just a great a read and true to the film, even the front cover of the book was so chilling. This film keeps you on edge of your seat the opening sequence so frightening I would never swim in the dark, but even the boy on the float ( blood splitting out everywhere )was just as terrifying, tbh I was shocked to learn decades later this film was only a PG as not only is it truly frightening it is gory, a mean a man gets are in half, another leg. No1 whowver saw this film growing up ever looked at water the same again and will have had nightmares no shark films even come close to this original, reading other comments now that the mechanical shark looked fake I honestly dont remember it doing I always remember it looking very real to me, certainly better than all the CGI cr@p 1s we get now

Farewell and Adieu ...,"Oh the sheer delight in finding someone - friend, relative, acquaintance- anyone - who utters the phrase, ""I've never seen Jaws"". From that moment it becomes a scheduling exercise leading to the viewing and the fun unfolds.

Memorable characters and dialogue, and likely one of most brutal scenes ever filmed.

The scene where Shaw's Quint describes his wartime experience on the USS Indianapolis - has the viewer riveted, and the look of horror on Brody and Hooper faces - demand repeated viewings if only for this one memorable scene.

Bravo Steven. If you had retired after this one we would still remember your name forever.

A Perfect Film,"There aren't too many perfect movies out there. This is one of them. The music alone tells a story. This could be a silent film and it would still have all of the intrigue and suspense. They, including Spielberg, don't make movies like this anymore. Filmmakers used to be bold. Too bad.

We get to know the characters through their fears, weaknesses, and strengths. And those same characteristics are weaved into the plot to move the story forward, or backward, and give it suspense. There's not one scene that feels like ""filler"" in the entire movie.

This movie hit on something visceral and didn't let up the entire time. Who's doing that nowadays?

A landmark film.,"Far from being a monster movie, this is a realistic and gritty example of a town which relies on summer trade having its beaches invaded by a dangerous shark. There are genuinely suspenseful sequences, a first-rate soundtrack and believable people. The character development of the three men in the boat shows there's a lot more to this film than just a rubber fin. I'd recommend this and Jaws 2 to any fan of drama/thrillers.

"Pretty good, but not his best","The acting were superb. You can clearly see the terror on the 3 main actors' acting throughout the film, especially the ending. Even though the shark looked a little fake, it WAS released in 1975 so that was already awesome.

I went into this movie expecting something thrilling, something that will leave me scared to go into water. I was left with a sense of disappointment. There wasn't enough suspense, and in some scenes, the music killed the vibe. The ending was... not what I expected for a horror film and it left me with an unpleasant feeling. The death scenes were not clearly shown/depicted. And I get that this film wasn't trying to be gory, but not being able to see the deaths and the bodies kinda made me feel frustrated.

I know that the making of this film required more money and time than expected and that it took a heavy toll on everybody, especially Steven. But that's no excuse for the poor execution of the ending. There were some unnecessary scenes that could be cut to save budget and they could have used that time to increase the suspense and thriller feel.

But overall it's an awesome classic movie that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life.",7/10,25 November 2017,ferluci-60903,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
A Timeless Thriller That Swims Above the Rest,"Jaws, directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, stands as a testament to the power of cinema and its ability to leave an everlasting impact. Released in 1975, this iconic masterpiece redefined the horror genre, captivating audiences with its gripping narrative, impeccable craftsmanship, and unforgettable characters. Even after nearly five decades, Jaws continues to send shivers down our spines and remind us why it remains one of the greatest films ever made.

Set in the picturesque coastal town of Amity Island, Jaws immediately immerses viewers in an atmosphere of impending doom. John Williams' spine-tingling score, featuring the legendary ""da dum"" theme, became synonymous with suspense and perfectly sets the stage for the heart-stopping journey that awaits. Spielberg's masterful direction heightens the tension, utilizing expertly crafted shots and a skillful balance of pacing to keep audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

The cast of Jaws delivers performances that are nothing short of exceptional. Roy Scheider's portrayal of Police Chief Martin Brody anchors the film with a relatable and nuanced performance, capturing the essence of a man torn between his duty and his fears. Richard Dreyfuss injects the film with infectious enthusiasm as the witty marine biologist Matt Hooper, while Robert Shaw steals every scene as the grizzled shark hunter Quint, infusing the film with a haunting blend of mystery and danger. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, adding layers of depth and authenticity to their interactions, making us truly invest in their struggles and triumphs.

One of Jaws' greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance horror with genuine character development. Beyond the relentless terror unleashed by the Great White shark, the film delves into the complexities of human nature. Chief Brody's transformation from an outsider to a reluctant hero, Hooper's unwavering commitment to his scientific pursuits, and Quint's haunting backstory all contribute to a rich tapestry of emotions that resonate long after the credits roll. It's a testament to Spielberg's visionary storytelling that these characters feel so vivid and memorable, anchoring the film in a reality that makes the horror all the more terrifying.

Visually, Jaws remains a marvel of technical achievement. The groundbreaking use of animatronics and practical effects, spearheaded by the late, great special effects artist Joe Alves, created a fearsome predator that felt tangible and menacing. Spielberg's masterful restraint in revealing the shark, opting for suspenseful glimpses and tension-building camera angles, demonstrates his understanding of the power of suggestion. The result is an enduring sense of dread that lingers throughout the film, magnified by the breathtaking underwater sequences that showcase the shark's sheer power and dominance.

Beyond its thrilling story and technical prowess, Jaws also carries a timeless environmental message. It serves as a reminder of the fragile balance between humans and nature, urging us to respect and protect the ecosystem that sustains us. This underlying theme, coupled with the film's undeniable entertainment value, elevates Jaws to a level of cinematic greatness that few films can achieve.

In conclusion, Jaws is an undisputed masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It continues to enthrall and terrify audiences, reaffirming its status as a cornerstone of cinema. Spielberg's visionary direction, coupled with outstanding performances and groundbreaking visual effects, make Jaws an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a fan of horror, character-driven narratives, or simply appreciate the power of storytelling, this film is a must-watch. Dive into the depths of Jaws, and brace yourself for an immersive, exhilarating, and truly unforgettable journey.

When the B movie became the A movie,"In the history of the cinema, this film (along with Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc.) will be remembered as the beginning of a new era. One hallmark of this new era, which is still with us, is that the genres that used to be confined to B movies--such as science fiction and horror--are now the subjects of major, respectable motion pictures. To me, it is a little sad that the ""big"" movies no longer aspire to serious themes, but instead confine themselves to the stuff of comic books. After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us. People go to the movies to see fancy special effects and get cheap thrills, not necessarily to explore interesting characters and stories.

That being said, the movie that started it all is still enjoyable on its own terms, particularly the second half, when it becomes a Moby Dick story of three men on a boat chasing and being chased by a big fish. The movie does a good job of showing the camaraderie that develops among the three.",7/10,18 May 1999,cinemabuff,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Classic Film.,"Review: 'Jaws' is a thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley. Even for the time it came out this movie is still entertaining as hell. It's not the most realistic take on a shark, but it tells a revenge story that keeps you engaged. In the film, a giant great white shark attacks beachgoer at a New England summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw). You can't say anything bad about the acting in this movie, especially from the main cast. I was surprised by that given the age of the film. There are only a select few films that I consider both classics and to have good acting. Spielberg brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. Between the acting, directing and the amazing score, this movie is one to be talked about for years to come still. Overall, this is yet another master craft from one of the greatest filmmakers out there. Nobody can walk away from watching this movie thinking it could have been better. 4.5/5",9/10,7 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Groundbreaking & still scary,"A 25-foot Great White shark is doing what he knows best  swimming around and eating when he gets hungry. In this case, his diet consists mostly of the people off the coast of Amityville, and Martin Brody (Scheider) the newly hired police chief has to not only protect the townspeople but also find the shark and kill it. Unfortunately, he has a few strikes against him right out of the box; the Mayor of Amityville is so mercenary he pretty much has to have a body dropped in his lap before he will acquiesce to closing the beach, he hires a crusty old curmudgeon of a shark hunter (Quint, played by Robert Shaw) who, while being good at what he does, has a beef with everyone who comes in contact with him (particularly oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss), and finally, Brody suffers from a little thing called hydrophobia.

The story is simple, yet the film is so well put together that it has held up as a horror classic for the last thirty years. Spielberg, at the time with only a few films and television shows under his directing belt, created a masterpiece with the film ""Jaws"", a film that is so good; its flaws become almost trivial when making an overall assessment of the film. Several great things occurred due to serendipity with ""Jaws"". Probably the best known was the trouble the crew had with the mechanical shark that led to underexposure of the monster; subsequently leading to a greater scare with the shard did appear. Spielberg, even with these formative films, knew how to create suspense and tension. The image of the three men on a rickety boat in the middle of the ocean where a man-eating shark who is looking for a 5th victim awaits is pretty scary. And that is one of the less obvious moments  never mind the shark bringing down a young boy, a dog, a young woman and man. (Unusually, the goriest actually being the death of the child.) Throw in a now iconic soundtrack and we have ourselves an instant classic.

Formally reviewing ""Jaws"" is pretty pointless when the movie is not only thirty years out of the can, but has been analyzed to pieces, but a mention has to be made about its lasting effect on pop culture. I know of at least one person who still will not go in the water as a direct result of this film, and while it is fair to expect that I was completely terrified of this film when I was 7 or 8, I'll admit that the movie poster still scares the hell out of me. I think the greatest thing that I found with ""Jaws"" is that a film that I remembered being so terrifying as a kid actually turned into a film that was terrifying for a completely different reasons when viewed as an adult. With this viewing I found ""Jaws"" to be more spine-chillingly suspenseful than anything; I really felt a sense of hopelessness for the plight of these men, and was scared on their behalf  more of an adult kind of terror than anything that simply goes ""Boo!"" ""Jaws"" isn't perfect  it actually has a pretty convenient ending that made me go, ""Wait  but- how will they.huh?"" But like I said earlier, it's things like this that make you realize that the rest of the film was good enough to forgive this transgression. I have always had a conflicted relationship with Steven Spielberg films; on the one hand, and as a self-labeled life long film student, I know how commercial his films are. But on the other hand, I can't deny that he makes damn good films. Maybe I should just lighten up about it and just enjoy, which I did while watching ""Jaws"" again, many years after seeing it for the first time. 8/10 --Shelly

Average at best.,"I think I'll never know what made this painfully average movie so loved by so many people. The only above average feature in this movie is the score other than that there's absolutely nothing special here. It's not even remotely scary, and It's really predictable too. The only interesting character in this movie is Quint, the rest of them are just eh. This movie is the definition of forgettable.

One of the best films ever.,"Synopsis: A police chief of a popular summer retreat island finds the tourist season in jeopardy when a great white shark attacks. With the mayor pressuring him to keep the beaches open for financial reasons, he teams up with a marine scientist and a certifiable fisherman to hunt the beast.

My Take: Is there a better horror film out there? I say no. This movie has it all, jumps, tears, laughter, and (most importantly) tension. Spielberg proved out of the gate that he knows where all of your strings are and that he can pluck any single one at will. What makes this film so incredible isn't the shark at all. It's the people. They are real three dimensional characters who share our fears and feelings. A simple example being when one mother walks up, slaps the police chief and sobs, ""My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that.""

Recommendation: I would also recommend Spielberg's made for T.V. movie Duel.",10/10,20 March 2009,schmee3spades,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Not your average fish story...,"Widely regarded as the film that began the ""summer movie blockbuster era"", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams). One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of ""aquaphobia"" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the ""less is more"" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.

One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.

No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold. Grade: A+",10/10,23 September 2001,WehoSteve,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
The Number One Movie Of ALL Time,"In My Opinion, This movie does what it should do.. keep you glued to the screen, gripping the arms of your loved one or sofa and 100% re-watchable. I grew up on this movie and book, And can say without a shadow of a doubt, Steven Spielberg did indeed make a classic, not only that he set the path for other amazing movies by other amazing directors, proving 'Young Talent' should be given a chance, as he was... He choose the right cast members, the right scene locations, an amazing and truly epic composer in John Williams and made us all remember that iconic music. its had its critics and its 'Follow Up' movies but to me there is not one scene or moment I would change in Jaws. it is exactly what it was intended to be.. a Summer blockbuster, To scare you into keeping out of the water and in your cinema seat

The Shark movie,"Steven Spielberg's film classic relies on old-time thrills and brilliant cinematography. The film is extremely well constructed. The beginning almost resembles the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock films. Where is the shark? Did I see it on the screen that others don't? Great work. The film is in a way two parts. In the first part, a shark threatens the community and is taking the summer tourist dollars. The second part is dedicated to shark hunting. The shark is menacing and intelligent. That wonderful monster made with old-school practical effects. CGI was not used at that time. After almost 50 years, the film is really fresh and a timeless classic.

A lesson in tension,"Who'd have thought that such a simple idea could be a film of such amazing impact, even decades later. It is a testament to Spielberg's directing abilities that this film still creates deep seated phobias in those that watch it!

Essentially a remake of Duel except with a shark replacing the truck this is a lesson in suspense for directors. With special effects now the audience tend to see everything in glorious colour - not much is left to the imagination. With Jaws we only see the fin, movements under water or the impact of the attack - the shark remains hidden until the end. This is the best option as it is very rubbery looking, but it also heightens the tension as the unknown moves under water to attack us.

Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody with great support from Dreyfuss and Shaw. The chemistry between the Dreyfuss and Scheider is perfect and Shaw is as tetchy as he needs to be. The dialogue is spot on in many scenes and has become part of the common knowledge of the world - being spoofed in films included Lethal Weapon 3, Chasing Amy to name two.

Later remade as Jurassic Park (!) this is a classic piece of tension. Ignore the rubber shark effects towards the end and sit back and marvel at what a master director can do with a simple story and basic effects.",No rating,17 October 2001,bob the moo,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Overlapping dialogue stinks,"Even if the overlapping dialogue is used to show to townspeople and pressure on the sheriff, it's thoroughly annoying and used through the whole film. And you can't pick out the speeches of the primary characters. It's a freaking noise machine.

The movie that has been terrifying ocean goers for years.,"Universal Pictures and Director Steven Spielberg brings the world ""Jaws"" the movie that has been terrifying ocean goers since it creation in 1975. Jaws is an adaptation of Peter Benchely's 1974 novel ""Jaws."" Still to this day people are scared of what is swimming below because of this classic film. Jaws is a movie about an unstable great white shark that is eating everything and everyone in its path. The film is based around a small island community called ""Amity,"" and shot on location at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.

The main star of the movie Chief Brady (Roy Scheider) is tasked with stopping this eating machine with the help of Marie Biologist and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). Along with fighting the shark Chief Brady has to fight the town board to close the beaches, which are the small towns only source of income. Chief Brody tries desperately to convince the towns people to listen to him because with the beaches open there is a virtual buffet served up for this 25- foot beast. To help corral the killer Chief Brody enlists roughneck shark hunt Quint (Robert Shaw), who hates sharks more than anyone. These three heroes go where no one else wants to go, the water, to kill this behemoth knowing they no match for the creature.

The truly amazing part of this movie is the score it is simple, but terrifying. Who knew that just two cords could have the effect it did on this film and people still to this day. The Jaws theme song is instantly recognizable. I remember as a younger man that every time I was at the public pool or lake that at least one other child would have his hands above his head like a shark fin and move through the water singing, dun da dun da dun da.

This movie was mainly shot with hand-held cameras is rough seas. The views of the ocean and the authenticity of the shark are breathtaking. This is a keep you at the edge of your seat kind of film. There is no wonder this movie was the highest grossing film of all time until Star Wars in 1977. Jaws received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and won three Oscars for best sound, best film editing, and best music- original dramatic score.

If you haven't seen this movie get out there and watch it. You will appreciate seeing the shark that started it all.",10/10,22 July 2016,elibauerleffler,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
I STILL have trouble with the deep-end of the pool,"I was VERY young when I saw this movie. I'm thankful for that for two reasons: there is NO WAY I could watch it again now without some therapy so I'll be able to keep enjoying water sports, and also because that was a time that movies need not be ultra-primo CGI to be ""impressive"". This just scares the crap right out of you on its own.

I remember hearing later that this movie unintentionally led to the hunting of Great Whites at a shocking level, which (if true) is horrible. As a surfer, spending days in an ocean Great White-free would be great, not having to worry about what's lurking about in my vicinity, and if it sees me as a juicy snack food. I have to say that the danger man-eating sharks pose to - well, man, is not a new concept and didn't start with this movie. So if a Hollywood movie made people suddenly afraid that sharks are a somehow new invention and needed their numbers suddenly controlled, I can't help but say how horribly sad that is - mostly for the sharks, but also for the people that let movies rile them up like that.

On a side note, I've heard of new(er) inventions that can keep a shark basically uninterested in you. Or at the very least, keep your limbs intact should the unthinkable happen. Sign me up! That being said, whatever my mother was thinking letting me watch this at such a young age (or ever, for that matter), especially with our frequent family trips to the beach, I have actually hoped for some kind of way that I could mentally block Jaws - at least on beach days. I'm actually thankful to have endured Jellyfish stings because Jellyfish don't friggin' eat you.


I remember this being a good and captivating movie, and likely the first ""horror"" movie I'd ever seen, sans ghosts; made up of real creatures and actual, possible events. It got the ""horror"" classification from me because I was terrified, just TERRIFIED, and came close so many times to needing to leave the theater if for nothing else than a change of pants. Good G-d. No demon from the front gates of hell could have an effect on me like one of these creatures.

My summers were never the same, even with all my childhood friends in my pool with me, in crystal clear water. The deep end was, without a doubt, off-limits for me. Had our household had only a bathtub but no shower, I would have had to be the dirtiest kid on our block to ever exist - we're talking Charlie Brown's smelly buddy level - because bathtubs were ruined for me too! For the record, it wasn't until years later that I learned how to surf. How or why, I ever managed to turn that idea into a reality bewilders me to this day, even though I love to surf. I'd have to say prescribed anti-anxiety pills may have helped the mental process though (the balance part, not so much). Waiting for a wave can be nerve-wracking. I'm good at it now, but I'll likely always have mini-panic attacks every time I think about the fact that my legs are dangling off a board into water that I can't see into, past a few inches (the Pacific is murky). And seeing a dolphin in the distance? Forget about it.

Need a visual into what has haunted me now my whole life? All I need to say is this: the cover of the movie. Just LOOK AT THAT THING! LOOK AT IT!! That swimming woman? She looks Barbie-sized compared to Jaws.

This is without a doubt a scary movie - but never say you haven't been warned! I recommend it, but NOT if you ever want to have peaceful thoughts about that swim you want to take tomorrow, or ever again at any time for the rest of your life.

If he's reading this - you are a talented, talented man, Steven Spielberg. Kudos to you, boychik. But ... I will NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR MAKING THIS!!

"""Stop playing with yourself, Hooper!""","Based on the novel of the same name, Jaws is set in a peaceful holiday town on Amity Island. When a young girl washes up dead, chief of police Martin Brody suspects a shark attack, however the mayor dismisses it as a boating accident and refuses to let Brody shut the beaches in fear of losing business. More and more people succomb to the shark, before Brody recruits oceanographer Matt Hooper and war veteran and shark hunter Quint to sail out and destroy it once and for all.

The original summer blockbuster, even today Jaws is a force to be reckoned with. All the characters are played to perfection by the 3 leads... being multi dimensional and most importantly, believable. The film keeps the shark more or less hidden throughout most of the film, with just that absolutely iconic musical motif to signify its presence. This was mostly due to them having issues with the mechanical shark and having to rework scenes, but this actually works in the films favour. The film brilliantly maintains suspense throughout it's entirety, and the final act is a masterclass in protagonist versus antagonist storytelling. Having the main character overcome his fear of the water and put his NYC police sniper background to good use while the boat sinks around him is incredible, and that iconic line ""smile, you son of a b..."" before delivering the fatal shot is one of the greatest payoffs in movie history. No shark film in the almost 50 years since release has even come close to bettering it, and Jaws single-handedly made everyone across the globe think twice about going onto the sea. Can you think of any other film that had that much of an impact? I can't... and that theme tune has got to be the most iconic and recognizable cinematic theme of all time... and it's 2 notes. 2 NOTES!!! An absolute masterpiece on every single level and utterly, utterly essential viewing.

Good film!,"Having seen a re-release of this back in 2012 this is one interesting shark film that sparked off the shark film craze!

Martin Brody the sheriff a small island town of Amity off of New England investigates numerous shark attacks in the water after a young girl goes skinny dipping in the sea & get's attack by an unknown 'killing machine'! It's only until they discover bites marks on a whale that they discover it could be something far worse, a Great White Shark! He & 2 other guys go in search for the shark & to kill it!

The film itself was great for it's time. Considering I myself wasn't around then I think it is a unique film all round! The suspense was also great in this film too teasing the audience until 3/4 of the way into the film! It's definitely one of those edge of your seat films admittingly, though in all honesty I have seen better shark films, like Shark Night 3D or Bait 3D which were both epic films, though Jaws is just as great!

The kills were OK, not to my standards but OK for a film of this calibre. The ending part was truly great, (Though not as epic as Jaws 2's ending) it was still a great way for the shark to get killed off!

I overall, thought this was a great film, not the best I have seen but a true classic! 7/10

I have mixed feelings about this movie.,"I still have mixed feelings about this movie. When I first saw it - on TV, in about 1985 - I was 9 years old. Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) love those fascinating, majestic fish. I started reading, learning and collecting everything I could find on sharks. I learned their Latin names, even though, obviously, I didn't speak Latin yet!

I was fascinated by sharks - to this day they remain among my favorite animals and remember everything about them, even though I'm as far from biology and zoology as can be! And then I learned that most people's reaction to ""Jaws"" was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of ""Jaws"" was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of ""Jaws""!

To sum it up - I would give the movie 9 stars for its value entertainment and minus 100 stars for what it did to sharks. My final verdict, then? I give it (? :) stars. As for the advice, I would tell you to read a few good books on sharks and watch a few good documentaries before seeing ""Jaws"", especially if your opinion on sharks is not favorable.",5/10,18 September 2000,Vassago,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
To date best by fsr a shark movie,"Movies like Mag n now meg 2 Make us recall Jaws and how amazing that movie was in those 50 years back. I have seen Jaws at least about 10 times and never get bored. It is the movie which made me love Hollywood movies and still holds that ground. With that much less technology back in the days and to produce such a classic was just a wonder of an art. I remember as I specifically went from my country to universal studios to watch the Jaws shark which was used for the movie. Unfortunately watching movies like Meg 2 only reminders of how amazing Jaws was. Everything was just perfect the acting the production the story line.

Scary,"I saw Jaws on the small screen but still definitely scary for sure. Jaws was the inspiration for Sharknado for sure, and the score by John Williams lives on forever. It's hard to believe Steven Spielberg made 1941 just four years later.

What to say?,"What can be said about this movie that has not been said a thousand times already. This is the movie that started the shark attack genre of films and 44 years later is still the best of them all. It is by pure happenstance that the wonderful suspense that build through the film by not seeing the shark is actually a direct fault of problems with the mechanical beast they made, affectionately called Bruce (This being an Easter egg for the name of the great white in Finding Nemo). And suspense does build, not because you are not aware that it is the shark killing people, but because unlike many of the films that came along in this genre, it is not in you face. It is a subtle threat and you can sympathize with the people that are being hunted. The cinematography here is phenomenal, as is the acting. This is one of Richard Dreyfus's best roles. This is a long, slow story that back in the 70's was scary as hell, but to a more desensitized group of movie watchers will still be good, but without a lot of the scare factor. This is one of my must see before you die movies.

An engrossing cinematic experience,"Jaws has stood the test of time. Another brilliant soundtrack by the legendary John Williams. And while Speilburg wishes he never made this film because of it's effects on shark killing (not to mention people's fear of the water) his movie changed the course of history. The principal photography rewrite coupled with Bill Butlers cinematography create a palpable window into vacationing in cape Cod where it's been discovered, 50 years later, that there are indeed great white sharks are hunting in the Atlantic Ocean just off of cape cod shores in MA.. A prophetic premise coupled with the vivid chrome color palette - and I still hear the echoes of Spanish lady while sitting in traffic as I head towards my own great America summer vacation.

I'll see you on the beach,"""Violent, nasty, crude. There was nothing in the picture (Jaws) that was personal to me. It was a calculated movie. I made each cut with glee, knowing the effect that it would have on the audience. I don't ever want to be involved in another picture like that."" – Steven Spielberg

Beginning with point of view shots of a ""killer"" stalking a group of naked teens, ""Jaws"" is part of a group of slasher flicks released in the 1970s and late 60s (""Black Christmas"", ""Targets"", ""Blood Feast"", ""Psycho"", ""Birds"", ""Halloween"", ""Peeping Tom"", ""Chainsaw Massacrew"", copious zombie flicks, ""Scream Bloody Murder"", ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" etc).

Like many of these films, ""Jaws"" is at times a cruel, dehumanising film, focusing entirely on relentless audience manipulation. Take, for example, the difference between Pal's ""War of the Worlds"" and Spielberg's 2005 remake. The difference between the two films is that Spielberg identifies with the aliens, just as he identifies with the shark which terrorises tourists in ""Jaws"". Spielberg is the shark/alien/camera trying to scare the wits out of us. Nothing else engages his interests.

Many filmmakers operate in an imaginative space somewhere between artist (giving formal expression to his/her ideas and feelings) and entertainer. Spielberg, however, is entertainer incarnate. Yet he is a curiously joyless, sadistic entertainer, always holding in severe check emotions of his own that he doesn't trust. This results in the saccharin and sentimental quality of his films. Films that rely on bogus feelings rather than searching out and expressing genuine emotions.

Unsurprisingly, two of Spielberg's great loves are John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock. Spielberg is like a hybrid of the two, the reactionary tendencies of Ford merged with the gleeful sadism of Hitch, with a little Capra hypocritically thrown in as penance. In one scene in ""Jaws"", music from Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" is played, whilst elsewhere Spielberg hits us with Hitchcock's ""Vertigo Zoom"". The film's all-male hunt against an unseen enemy further recalls Ford's ""The Lost Patrol"", whilst its elaborate last act recalls ""Lifeboat"". And of course ""Jaws"" is a virtual remake of ""Creature from the black Lagoon"", from which it takes its famous ""duh duh duh"" musical score, as well as numerous scenes, shot for shot. But most of all, ""Jaws"" beats the path of ""The Godfather"", a film that pioneered, in Hollywood, the pornographic technique of manipulating the audience into a state of delighted anticipation of each subsequent but oh-so-artful act of violence.

Prior to ""The Godfather"", Hollywood films generated, or at least tried to generate, concern for their vulnerable characters. With ""Jaws"", though, Spielberg appeals instead to the basest elements in our nature; in his hands, we cannot wait for the shark to claim another victim. Indeed, beginning with ""Jaws"", Spielberg made cold-hearted audience manipulation, in various guises, his signature track. Since then, the whole way in which popular entertainment operates has coarsened, the social and political consequences of which have been enormous. Of course Spielberg was simply part of an emerging trend. The true model for the cold-blooded cinema that ""Jaws"" exemplifies can be found in another time and place. The Third Reich created the approach; in its propagandistic works, audiences were encouraged to savour each new incidence of derision and abuse that befell Jewish characters.

Thematically ""Jaws"" is light (the shark's effects on local trade are quickly dismissed in favour of mechanical thrills). Where the film excels, where it breaks away from the 50's monster and 70's slasher genre, is in its masterful final act. Here, the haunted house goes out to sea in search of the slasher, our adventurers picked off ""Halloween"" style (with the genre's obligatory false-deaths) before a Moby Dick modelled showdown.

It is here where the film's characters - police chief Brody, goofy marine biologist Hooper and Quint (Robert Shaw), an Ahab-like fisherman who is obsessed with slaying the beast – develop. The last of these, Quint, is given a long histrionic speech, written by John Milius, in which he reminisces about a WW2 experience that plunged him into shark-infested waters (the passage links the film to pulpy movies of the 1950s, where atomic energy upsets Nature). Spielberg's inability to keep a reign on his older actors (Shaw was frequently drunk) and the input of Milius' pen (the rest of the film was written by Benchley, Gottlieb and Spielberg) created a mutiny of sorts, the result being the most well-drawn characters in Spielberg's filmography.

Ultimately, though, ""Jaws"" is a middle class, cosy version of ""Moby Dick"". The monster cathartically dies (Melville's whale survives), Quint is killed, and post-War virtues survive, Brody doggy-paddling back to his wife and family. Like ""Deliverance"" we are offered versions of threatened manhood, only here, Quint, a self-reliant, working-class, antiquated, thoroughly sexist, ruthless, raunchy and mad figure, is seen to be the anachronism. Quint is too powerful, too independent of traditional social ties, too prone to excess, too much a symbol of bourgeois independence, as dangerous to the social fabric of Amity's comfortable ""liberalism"" as the shark itself, and so he is cast aside.

In Spielbergland, paternal authority must always be restored, but not by Quint. Hopper and Brody on the other hand, are the mirror images of Quint. They are symbols of technology, genteel, inherited wealth, whilst the shark ultimately becomes another Spielbergian guarantor of domesticity. Be it dinosaurs, aliens, terrorists, Nazis, sharks, trucks, Germans, slave-traders or pirates, Spielberg's ""monsters"" are all symbols of paternal/national duty. Slay the beast for country and family, and all will be well. Family values, patriarchy, a kind of middle-class submissiveness, must always be restored. And this is the offencive thing about all of Spielberg's films: the absolute insistence on taking on the responsibilities of fatherhood, and thus restoration of a 1950s nuclear family, as an unquestionable and totally redemptive gesture.

8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.

We're gonna need a bigger boat...and probably a scarier shark,"Jaws is a thriller about a shark that has a taste for human blood, naturally this is going to be a problem as the summer season is actively approaching.

The actors don't really stand out but they play their roles well. The music is very well written and although most of the songs are forgettable, the main theme is pretty iconic. The dialogue is very effective at conveying the characters emotions in the moment feel very natural. The story is fairly basic and predictable but it has some interesting elements that keep it different. The movie does an excellent job building suspense, even though the shark itself isn't ever really scary.

The shark itself looks and behaves in ways that feel fake, especially in a scene near the end of the movie. It might be scary to some but for me it was rather laughable, luckily the suspense building and plot do enough to make up for that. A few characters never get enough development to be likable, in general characters are not particularly interesting.

It's fair to say at this point that Jaws is a classic and if you haven't seen it before you should! It's flawed and I have a hard time understanding how this film genuinely struck fear into many but the presentation of the plot, suspense and theme help this feel very immersive.",7/10,26 July 2024,AgentPhoenixxx,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
"""This was not a boat accident!""","*The* original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the ""summer blockbuster"", ""Jaws"" remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.

The story deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens & visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.

Roy Scheider is perfect as the Everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.

On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget *that* music by John Williams, the composer / conductor who's given us some of the best, most instantly recognizable movie themes of all time?

The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark ""Bruce"" to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hoopers' night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.

An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, ""Jaws"" is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar ""nature strikes back"" thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have ""Jaws"" on the brain.

"""Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Go Back In The Water!""","Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary star in Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller based on the novel. This takes place on a resort island, Amity and begins with a young girl falling victim to a great white killer shark. Soon, the shark kills again and starts terrorizing the residents on the beaches. Police chief, Martin Brody (Scheider) tries to keep them out of the water and stop the shark with help from a fisherman, Quint (Shaw) and marine biologist, Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss). Gary plays Martin's wife, Ellen who is also the mother of their 2 children. This classic paved the way for many killer shark/creatures in the water imitations. It's definitely one of Spielberg's best with a great cast and unforgettable score by John Williams that I recommend.

A well-made film which efficiently manipulate its elements of suspense and horror...,"The film opens with a shot of a group of teenagers enjoying a campfire out on Amity beach... A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim... The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them...

In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water... When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...

Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene...

Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island...

But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches... Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) tries with his town officials to convince the insecure police chief to file the incident as a 'boating accident.'

Brody reluctantly agrees, but later regrets his decision after few more fatal incidents... The shark has claimed Amity Island as his territory...

Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric old shark killer, offers to kill the menacing Great White Shark for ten thousand dollars...

Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), an arrogant young oceanographer, proves that the giant shark that killed Christine Watkins is still on the loose... 'They caught a shark. Not the shark,' he determines... and predicts future outbursts of attack activity in the area...

Brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life-and-death hunt... They go after the monstrous creature with rifles and poison pistols... They try to tire him, slowing him down with coiled ropes and barrels... They fight him with everything, harpoons, poles, gaffs and compressed air tanks...

Shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II...

Scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating... His line to Quint ('You're going to need a bigger boat."") suggests a specific cause...

Dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it...

Spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart-stopping scenes wonderfully engaging... His grasp for sustaining the feeling of terror comes not only from what we see, but from what we're afraid we're going to see... He uses an imposing classical score to prepare the audience for something really scary that is about to show up...

With every breath, every thought, heart beat and movement, the realism of the increasing menace is present from the opening to the end... And believe me, we are never allowed the relief of looking away from the screen

Good,"JAWS was rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies and the recipient of an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Roy Scheider is wonderful as cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a coastal island town. The screenplay is tight and well-written. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.

Review - Jaws,"This movie had one of the best marketing campaigns in cinema history. It is astounding to see the number of people who bite the bait of the tagline: ""You'll never go in the water again!"" However, Jaws shares more resemblance with The Old Man and the Sea than with Ridley Scott's Alien. Don't expect an alien-esque horror film. Jaws demands more patience to be enjoyable because, first and foremost, it is a fishing film.

That brings me to another misconception about the film, the beginning is slow, really slow, and pointless. Fortunately, Spielberg's skillful directing was there to insufflate some energy into that otherwise bothersome first act.

If you haven't already seen Jaws, I do say go for it. It remains a classic of Hollywood cinema, but keep in mind that what you are about to see is not an action film nor a horror film.

The true definition of a classic movie,"Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.",10/10,4 July 2016,heisenberg12,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
An instant classic!,"When I first saw the film, ""Jaws"" I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean...literally! Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!",10/10,10 March 2004,TruPretender,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Nearly perfect storytelling,"It's close-to-perfect storytelling. Sort of like having lightning in a bottle. The perfect balance between style and substance.

The perfect antagonist: a monster with ""dead eyes"", a mindless killer whose purpose is to eat as many humans as possible.

An excellent protagonist: a cop, torn between protecting the townsfolk and looking out for his own family, while striving to appease a myopic mayor who is more akin to the shark than to an empathetic human.

The perfect sidekicks: a brainy oceanographer, whose knowledge is vital to the mission, and a cantankerous but competent local fisherman with lots of baggage, but whose acumen as a sailor makes him indispensable. Quint's rough exterior masks a deeply wounded man, and we're only given enough of a glimpse of his pain to understand what drives him, but paradoxically, we are left knowing very little about him, still. ( If you haven't noticed, Quint is my favorite character)

The acting is well executed. The director's choices are impeccable. And the film is written to be tight and efficient. All this is accomplished without fancy CGI, in less runtime than the average modern blockbuster. Nearly... (because perfection doesn't exist) a perfect movie.",9/10,6 September 2023,matthewsneed,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
We Need a Bigger Boat,"Producer Richard Zanuck at Universal bought the movie rights to Peter Benchley's novel ""Jaws"" before the book had even been published. Then he selected 27-year-old Steven Spielberg to direct, although the guy had only made a single feature film before (The Sugarland Express). The studio counted on a fairly simple shoot and aimed to have the movie ready for a Christmas premiere 1974.

In the movie, a New England coastal resort is terrorized by a giant white shark. Three men head out in a small fishing boat to kill it.

Unfortunately, problems arose immediately. Spielberg wanted to avoid shooting at the studio lot, and instead took the entire film crew to Martha's Vineyard on the east coast. Where there were difficulties with the unruly ocean, annoying crowds of curious tourists and the constant need to revise Peter Benchley's manuscript. But the biggest concern was caused by Bruce, the mechanical shark.

Bruce (so named after Steven Spielberg's lawyer) was built in three different versions, each with its own, specialized function. The first one sank, while the second exploded. It was only with the third, automated shark that the director was able to finish his film. But by now the shoot was so far over the schedule, that the crew believed they had a real disaster on their hands.

""Jaws"" was supposed to be opening for Christmas 1974, but because of all the delays it was pushed back to the summer of the following year. Back then, that was traditionally the time when the worst movies were dumped into theaters as people typically enjoyed the outdoors instead. But Universal aggressively marketed the film as an ""event"", especially in expensive, primetime spots on TV. And it worked. ""Jaws"" became the first movie to return over $100 million to its studio. The exciting era of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" was upon us.",8/10,26 February 2023,Prince-P,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
Roll Up - Roll Up - Meet the guy who didn't like it much!,"A killer shark throws a seaside town in to chaos.

In my movie writing I tend to be benign about movie that seek only to entertain the popcorn munchers, because they keep the industry going. However there are good popcorn movies and bad popcorn movies.

(Indeed there are popcorn movies that fall in to the middle.)

I was in the playground when this movie came out and the school morons thought this was fantastic - ""did you see that naked woman being bitten in half - wasn't that great. All that blood in the water - fantastic!"" They said, wide-eyed with wonder.

(In most movies rated PG women are not bitten in half, so congratulations to Steven S for getting a horror movie stunt shown to kids. And he repeated the trick in Jurassic Park!)

I am sorry that special effects were anything other than special in the 1970's. Yes the shark looks as dead as a dodo, but sharks do look a bit like that anyway. I have been to one of the few places where you can view sharks close to in safety and they do look a bit dead-in-the-eye. They like to come very close just to see you!

At the risk of starting a ""I'm right - you're wrong"" debate, let us look at what this is: A cheap thrill ride. Psycho and The Shinning were also cheap thrill rides, so let us not knock it for that, but it is worthless as any kind of document about sharks. A few rouge and hungry sharks kill humans, but they really don't like us much. Of all the food in the sea we are among their least favourite!

(Does Steven S ever think how much misinformation he has given the world with this film?)

The opening shots are, as our school moron said before, skillful and shocking. John Williams is a genius and produces more fright with a chamber orchestra than Spielberg does with a film camera! A master craftsman at work.

Sadly the script is flabby and indeed it is just an exercise in filling time before the next cheap thrill or even cheap thrill that never happens. When this film moves it moves well - but Schneider's paranoia is one note and pointless. We know he is right and the town-folk masses are wrong. A better script would have made him doubt himself.

We have read about how difficult life filming ""on the boat"" was. The steady cam - not available at the time - was designed to overcome these problems. It looks like they quit early, they could (and should) have extended the climax having kept us waiting for it for so long. Films like The Perfect Storm show that you can keep a scene going longer than they realized in the 1970's.

What I learned from Jaws is that films can get away with the murder if they open and finish well. What people who own the video or DVD do in the scenes that involve Schneider's troubled domestic life I don't know - probably hit fast forward I guess.

Most blockbusters are actually poor movies: Spiderman, Superman and Batman got a lot of hype and word-of-mouth - but future generations will see them as the flimsy flashy trash that they really are. What is the legacy of Jaws - spreading a load of c**p about the nature of sharks and making teenyboppers - who have even seen a real horror movie - scream?

Yes - there are plus points. Lots of pros at work both behind and in front of the camera and a great score - but all these people working their hardest cannot disguise that all they are working with a third rate pulp novel from a third rate novelist.",6/10,11 October 2004,Pedro_H,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
The First Summer Blockbuster,"I think this must be at least my 50th watch of Jaws. Steven Spielberg directs a masterclass in suspense with some excellent technical achievements alongside the exciting story. John Williams' score is possibly the best one of all time, the editing is brilliant, sound design and cinematography are also top notch. Roy Scheider is perfectly cast as Chief Brody and the banter between Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw is worth the watch alone. Murray Hamilton is also great as the ignorant mayor and Lorraine Gary brings a warmth to the role of Ellen Brody. Highlights are the opening scene attack, Alex Kintner's death, the jump scare of the head inside the hull of the boat and Quint's monologue about the USS Indianapolis. Jaws is truly one of the best cinematic experiences of all time and every summer blockbuster thereafter have this film to thank for paving the way.

"Ladies and gentlemen, INTRODUCING... Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d!","by no means a light-hearted family bonding movie of survival however. It's an outright claw and scramble your way to safety, every man for yourself - I guess we have to work together now bloodbath. This ride gets down to brass tacks right away. No build up. You are off on the first hill full speed ahead.

""Jaws"". humph. Jaws. Wrong title for this movie. The name of this film should be ""Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d"". To me - what's the shark? The pinnacle of natural organic breeding that happened to spawn one of the biggest sharks on the planet. That's like anthropomorphizing a volcano and calling the film ""Lava Hands"". That mayor single-handedly murdered at least 5 poor innocent folks just to keep his little tourist town revenue stream up. But, like real life - I don't see jails for the likes of this guy. Sadly - in the end - we don't see him out on the boat, taking up arms, and dying trying to right things in the progress. Classic. Now that's real! Now, you would think these kinds of plot devices and over all story arc to not be a Spielberg trope or standby, odd - well, that's because this movie is actually based on a popular book released barely over a year prior; and after Steve processed it, add an timeless Mr. Williams - and bam. It's an instant classic movie.

The pacing in this film overall, and dating still stands up well to time. It has believable characters, the actors mesh well, and it has far more than it's share of horror aspects cemented in place. Horror? This is a horror movie? Oh, bet your ass it is - when you think about it, it's actually worse. This damn thing could be out there right now, stalking swimmers - ready to ""swallow whole"" the next hapless poor soul. It's a 25+', 3 ton, hunting, stalking, never-sleeping, murder machine.. and you cant see it until it's right up on ya. Oh, and by the way, bullets loose their kinetic energy after less feet in water than you realize. So good luck.

What's best overall about this film? IT IS PG. No kidding. This film had more gore than half the rated R horror films in the last 15 years, and it has legs, arms shooting off. It has people being eaten alive, bitten in half, and desperation at ridiculously stressful moments. It has FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. But - no swearing. Thank god! This might just be something you couldn't show at church. That's something I forget to mention about yesterday's film, Poltergeist... another Spielberg film - PG. No kidding there - faces ripped off, parents smoking pot with kids in the house, mom getting raped by a entity... but no swearing. Whew! This film, a first in it's series is a classic Hollywood example of starting a franchise after a clear ending - simply due to the overwhelming success. While it's not the first killer ""believable"" animal horror film, it's definitely one of the earliest that comes to mind in your average horror fan.

Jaws,"Probably the most inspired piece of casting in the movie is the use of Richard Dreyfuss as the oceanographer. He made this film soon after playing the driven, scheming, overwhelmingly ambitious title character in ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,"" and the nice kid, college-bound, in ""American Graffiti."" Here he looks properly young, engaging, and scholarly, and introduces the technical material about sharks in a way that reinforces our elemental fear of them. Which brings us to the shark itself. Some of the footage in the film is of an actual great white shark. The rest uses a mechanical shark patterned on the real thing. The illusion is complete. We see the shark close up, we look in its relentless eye, and it just plain feels like a shark. ""Jaws"" is a great adventure movie of the kind we don't get very often any more. It's clean-cut adventure, without the gratuitous violence of so many action pictures. It has the necessary amount of blood and guts to work -- but none extra. And it's one hell of a good story, brilliantly told.

Men Acting Like Morons: The Movie,"Jaws is not about a giant shark, it is about the enormously stupid egos of a bunch of men living in a small seaside resort town near Cape Cod in the mid-1970s.

First there's the arrogance of the Mayor Vaughn, and the greed of associated town business men, then there's the arrogance of the three men out on the boat. Really unnecessary lengths of scenes are devoted to Brody, Quint and Hooper competing with each other and acting like jerks in a locker room.

I don't think this movie holds up well and I like horror films from the 1970s. This isn't really horror, it's more like an action film for dude bros to watch.

I mean, I hope you all realize this movie has been condemned by animal welfare interests and wildlife conservationists for its unrealistic demonizing of sea life. It's the entire reason we have Shark Week to educate ignorant people about the poor fish.",4/10,3 September 2024,thalassafischer,Jaws (1975),NEGATIVE
A classic for a reason.,"From the opening scene I'm hooked. Every time I see this film it's still as good as the first time. There's shark attacks, arguments about closing the beach, more shark attacks and finally the humans attack the shark. Phenomenal camera work, pacing and music. Great characterization: a shark freak from the institute, a police chief who's concerned for his town, a grizzled fisherman who's killed many sharks, and a mayor who is just after the dollar. Nothing bad about this movie at all, just perfect from start to finish.

Jaws is horrifyingly unforgettable.,"Few films have made a more permanent impact on my life than Jaws did. This film absolutely terrified me as a kid, and I have more than once convinced myself that a great white shark was just below the surface of the water, even while I was swimming in a lake or a public pool. And while many people focus on the horror aspects of this movie, as they should, it also has fully rounded, relatable characters and lighthearted, humanizing scenes. It's no surprise to me that this film killed at the box office. Between Steven Spielberg's directing and John Williams' score, Jaws is horrifyingly unforgettable.

The Best Movie Ever Made,"It is redundant to write something outlining the fact that JAWS is a brilliant film. There is nothing that can be said at this point that hasn't already been said. People have written about the rubber shark. Everyone knows that the shark's name is Bruce. Everyone knows that it was named after Spielberg's lawyer. Everyone knows that the shark didn't work all the time. Everyone knows that Dreyfuss and Shaw didn't get along. The list goes on... Still, for some reason, this movie inspires people, myself included, to write, write, and write. More importantly, it inspires us to read, read, and read. We need to know that we're not all crazy for loving this movie. We need to know that we can sit there and heave a collective sigh of relief, of comfort, when we watch it. We need to know that there are others like us who love this movie on every level. It touches us. We are Chief Brody when we're scared. We get excited in a very geeky way over things we love like Hooper. We all have moments of bravado like Quint and we're happy to know that he gets scared too. Most of all- we love sharks. We can't help it.

This movie is brilliant. There is not a single thing that you could do to it that would make it better. They haven't created an award with a broad enough scope that would be appropriate for this movie to win. It's an action movie, a horror movie, a buddy movie, a drama; it is everything. It is why we go to movies.

If you have not seen this movie then stop what you are doing. I don't care if you are delivering a baby- it can wait. You can not go any further in your life without seeing JAWS. If you've seen it before- finish delivering the baby... then go watch it again.",10/10,29 December 2008,crispin_13,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Jaws rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jaws is simply a perfect movie. The first megahit for Steven Spielberg and a deserved one, because the film is at all points great! The music from John Williams is one of the best a movie has ever had. The main players (Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw) are outstandingly good, so are the others by the way and the line ""you gonna need a bigger boat"""" is so true and also one you won't forget.

Jaws looks very good, if you see him, 'cause you don't get to see him that often. The shots at the water are also of a high quality. They are very threatening. This is a movie you have to see at least once in your lifetime.(Even the second time you are chained to your seet). Something you would almost forget: not all the sharks kill people"". There are far more sharks killed by people than there are people killed by a shark!!!

It wasn't a propeller.. It wasn't a coral reef.. And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.. It was a Shark!,"***SPOILERS*** It's when teenager Cassie, Susan Blacklinie, went skinny dipping one evening in the waters off Long Island Sound that she attracted this giant 25 foot great white shark who ended up taking her out and under for his dinner! With the July 4th festivities about to start the seaside town of Amity, who's economy depends on tourist summer dollars, the news that a killer and man eating shark is on the loose off it's waters is the last thing that the town fathers and its Mayor Vaughn, Murray Hamilton, want the public to know about! It's when against his better judgment due to the pressure put on him by Mayor Vaughn Amity Police Chief Brody,Roy Scheider, kept the beaches opened that the killer shark strikes again gulping down another victim in front of hundreds of terrified beach goers including Chief Brody. With panic engulfing Amity and after a false report of having harpooned and killed the shark he strikes again this time in shallow waters off Amity Island. This on July 4th taking down another victim and thus closing the beaches indefinitely until the shark, the real killer shark not a cheap imitation,is finally put out of commission!

With Mayor Vaughn and the town fathers finally coming to their senses their forced to hire the famed shark hunter Captain Quint, Robert Shaw, at $10,000.00 plus expenses to track down and kill the man eating shark before he adds more victims to his already impressive body count. There's also the young wise cracking Oceanographer Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss, who goes along for the ride together with chief Brody on Quint's shark hunting boat the Orca. It's Hooper's know it all attitude about marine life and sea fearing that starts to get under Quint's skin and almost leads the two to go at each other instead of at the killer shark. It's only later on that Hooper gains a new found respect for Quint when he finds out that his obsession with sharks and wanting to kill them was the result of an incident back in WWII where he almost ended up together with most of his 700 fellow US Navy sailors, on the torpedoed USS Indianapolis, being eaten by one of them.

With the three, Quint Brody & Hooper, shark hunters out at sea is when the killer shark, efficiently called Bruce, comes out in the open with his razor sharp and serrated teeth, as much as three rows of them,flashing. From then on it's a battle between man and beast on the open seas with the killer shark making the best of the situation. It's his turf or waters that he's battling in and he knows every drop of it. That's until Brody now on his own with nothing to lose, but his life, overcomes his fear of the high seas and together with a high powered rifle and full oxygen tank finally turns the tables on the surging like a train locomotive Bruce the Shark. With Brody leaving about just enough of him,all 25 feet and three ton's worth, to fully pack an 8 to 12 once sardine can!

P.S ""Jaws"" released in the early summer of 1975 became the biggest money making hit in motion picture history in only just six weeks after it's initial release! Surpressing and almost doubling the profits of the previous money earing champ ""The Godfather"" without as much as breaking a sweat in doing it. Not at first thought to become the mega monster hit, with all the troubles and delays in filming it, that it turned out to be ""Jaws"" astounded the movie critics as well as it's own cast & crew members who before it's release had them feeling that it was going to be the ""Bomb"" of the century, and end up destroying their careers, who tried to distance and disown themselves from the film. Check out the author of the novel ""Jaws"" that the film was based on Peter Benchley as a TV reporter on the Amity beach just before the killer shark springs or swims into action.",7/10,20 May 2012,sol-kay,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Jaws Is To Spielberg As Psycho Is To Hitchcock,"Of the many blockbuster films Steven Spielberg directed, I wonder if this might wind up as his most famous years from now. Like Hitchcock and ""Psycho,"" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!

No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching.

The shark, which can look a little phony on occasions, is still frightening and the music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!

I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing. The more I watch this, the more I wish the shark had eaten more of them, like Richard Dreyfuss and Murray Hamilton.",9/10,24 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,Jaws (1975),POSITIVE
Great one in the 70s,"Can't believe the movie was made in 1970s. It's even better than some movies made nowadays especially the special effects. The shark looks so real and the culling scenes are extraordinarily real. The crew spent two years to make the movie, receiving 67 million viewers globally. It was cinematically played in 14 countries in 17 different languages and was nominated for 18 awards. Although the plot may be a little tedious in these days but It was a milestone for horror movies in the 70s and 80s. The director, Steven Spielberg is also a legendary film maker. He has produced and directed many great movies. I recommend to buy the DVD for this movie because there are many things you don't see on streaming/in cinemas.

The best film ever made.,"I saw this film when I was about 8 years old. And what I remember most about it, is thinking that I had found the most frightening film that I had ever seen. When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ). To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming. I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life. Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break. Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me. "" Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? "" I asked them. Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.

Jaws is perfect on every level of film making. It has incredibly well developed characters, so well that we feel their fears and their bravado when we are supposed to. The direction is some of the best I have ever seen. We are but marionettes in Spielberg's fingers. When he wants us to feel, he pulls our strings and masterfully we feel scared or horrified or even amused. A perfect example of this is the killing of the Kinter kid, the second death of the movie.

The scene starts off shortly after Chrissie Watkins is killed. There are people playing on the beach and in the water. Brody ( the police chief ) is sitting tentatively watching things intently. He hears screams from a young girl. But of course they are playful screams. Then we see a man playing fetch the stick with his dog. Finally we meet Alex Kinter. He goes out on his raft into the water. Then we see the shots from under water. It's as if something is approaching. We're really not sure if we are being teased here or not. But then we see a stick floating in the water and the man calling out for his dog. But he is not there. Then we see more kids splashing and then we cut to a shot approaching the Kinter boy on his raft from under water. And the music. And then...... well, we all know what happens. Now that is a director masterfully manipulating us.

Jaws stands up to and surpasses any film these days that is considered brilliant and it surpasses anything that came before it. This film should have cleaned up at the Oscars. After all, what film is remembered more? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ( a very good film ) or Jaws? The answer is quite clear.

We're gonna need a bigger boat,"Yea, ""Jaws"" is considered a classic for many people. I admit this is my first time seeing this, and I'm not that amazed as people say this movie makes you be.

The first hour is not that interesting and nothing much really happens. Just a bunch of old people talking and talking. The movie actually isn't interesting until you finally see the sea monster. The actors do their jobs very well, but the writer could have made it with more action; that's one thing that ruined it for me.

Spielberg's direction is great, but ""Jaws"" is not changing anybody's life; it's just pure entertainment with the ending we wanted to see.

A potboiler of the 'slow-death' variety,"A potboiler with grisly action scenes that border on the ridiculous, 'Jaws' is another of the 'slow-death' entertainers of the 70's era. The premise is simple, and the ending predictable. Special effects are of the 70's quality, so sometimes they made the scene quite funny. The actors don't impress. The shark doesn't impress. There are some gaps in the story line. It must have been popular because of the shock value the scenes had in the era it was released. It was one of the most successful films ever. Spielberg has made much better films later on. Good cinema should endure. This didn't.

Watch it only if you want some comedy of the ridiculous kind.

Spielberg turns weak story into a cinematic masterpiece.,"Every once in a while the right talented people are at the right place together and come up with a masterpiece. ""Jaws"" is definitely one of those movies, that is thanks to the amazing cast and the crew the classic masterpiece that it is today.

Let's face it, the story is dumb and silly and in a way very average. Spielberg magically turns the silly story into a tense exciting thriller with brilliant dialogue and classic scene's. Mark my words, ""Jaws"" is a movie that will never be considered outdated.

Everything in the movie works so well! The acting, the dialogue, the tension, the typical Spielberg humor, the music, everything! It's hard to name just one thing why this movie is such a masterpiece. It is the mix of everything combined that makes the movie work. Probably my favorite thing about the movie would be the dialogue, they are very raw and performed well by the perfect cast. Another thing of course would be the music and I'm not just talking about the main theme but about the entire musical score in general.

The cast is great but they are mainly great together. All of the Scheider/Shaw/Dreyfuss scene's are like three ingredients thrown together and the end result of it is pure gold.

And than Bruce the shark. Yes, he really looks believable even now days.

A real classic masterpiece that launched Spielberg's career
